Questions
==========

What do you recommend for entry or forced entry in a medical emergency? Do you have any recommendations or programs for residential key lockboxes? What about smart locks? Do you have any preferred recommendations? What are the security and emergency risk tradeoffs you'd talk about with residents and businesses?

How fast can you arrive on scene versus first first responders? At what distance or time interval would you be able to typically reliably overtake neighbor first first responders? Does it vary by your geography in this emergency district? How would you set the distance, specifically the spatially or temporally measured radius, for first first responders? 

Do you provide any regular neighborhood training for emergency response? How can I get integrated into your calmunity systems?

In a neighbor 90 second or 3 minute rush using a car, where should the car of the first first responder be parked? Should it be abandoned anywhere or will that interfere with EMS/police/fire vehicle arrival? What's the general advice we can deliver on parking? Spend no more than 10 seconds finding parking, don't block or esp don't fully block fire engine traffic but break normal parking laws or conventions if needed to race in faster? Park in front of hydrant for nonfire or never park in front of hydrant even in emergency? They don't have much time to think - they're going to be overwhelmed preparing and racing, it has to be pretty simple and permissive
