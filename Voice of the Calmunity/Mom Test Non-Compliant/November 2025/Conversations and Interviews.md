Boca Raton Food Service Worker, Male 20s
----------------------------------------
Talked with worker at Chipotle, a tall male likely in his 20s. I told him a bit about the project and asked him if he would respond to a Neighbor 911 call. At first he was uncertain and noncommittal, because the picture I had painted for him was a case of domestic violence, and it turned out he was fearful that he might be walking into a situation where there's a knife or a gun involved. But then I painted him a different picture, a more typical case, where there's a Safeword™ or similar bedroom consent conflict emergency where there's one person who's aroused and not listening or heeding boundaries and another who's in flight, fight, freeze, or fawn response. He changed his mind and said he probably would be happy to go and do a doorknock to keep anyone vulnerable safe in a situation like that.

I also talked to him about whether he felt it would be a good idea for us to offer reward incentives / interruption compensation of $18 or $36 for that kind of service. He felt like in the context of bedroom consent conflicts offering interruption compensation or rewards might interfere with civic and safety-focused motivation and might also draw out the wrong kinds of people for the wrong motives. He felt uncomfortable with the idea of being paid back $18 or $36 for interrupting a consent conflict. I asked him about another example, whether it would make sense to offer a reward bounty for a lost dog, to motivate people to keep their eyes out for and report or chase after a dog that was lost in the neighborhood. He reacted by saying that in that context rewards made a lot of sense to him as a way of promoting the sad situation to enough people's attention.

He was pretty excited by the project potential and wanted to confirm his memory of the name of the service, double checking that this project was called Neighbor 911. 

Boca Raton Teens, Two Males, 13 and ~15
----------------------------------
I had two young teen males asking me what code I was working on on my laptop, and I explained to them the fundamentals of Neighbor 911™. I said to the younger one, who was 13, that I thought he could keep someone alive with CPR; I thought he was likely old enough. He said he didn't know (he hasn't been trained yet), and the 15 year old confidently said he learned CPR in school and felt calmfortable doing CPR if necessary in an emergency.

I looked up age requirements for good-quality CPR after this conversation and the American Heart Association finds that 12+ year olds are generally capable of good-quality CPR with regular 2-inch depth chest compression. Younger than that many 10-12 year olds don't have the strength or body weight to achieve 2 inch chest compression. Persons who are age 15+ are generally fully equivalent to adults on sustained CPR chest compression for multiple minutes, with swapping with another rescuer.

<10 → Can help, call 911, use AED, maybe do shallow compressions
10–12 → Can perform CPR but may not consistently reach required depth, and may not be able to do rescue breaths
12–14 → Most can perform effective adult-quality CPR with rescue breaths
15+ → Equivalent to adults 

Boca Raton SCORE Mentor / Advisor
---------------------------------
Talked with a SCORE mentor about this pivot into launching an open source project for Neighbor 911™. He urged me to do a lot more interviews with people to figure out the voice of the calmunity and what people actually need, and whether there really is a need. He pointed out that in his gated calmunity, there's a security guard about a minute away from his house who could respond to an emergency if called. Neighbor 911™ could be valuable for him as a way of connecting him to his security guard in an emergency, but for him the 24/7 security guard he has within a minute's reach may be a suitable option for a lot of emergency response cases like choking or maybe even solitary rapid CPR.

He recommended focusing on a very small, local market at first, to achieve a sustained small two-sided market of sufferers (demand) and minute responders (supply) where demand and supply testing could begin and be sustained, ideally picking on a very dense urban center like New York City, LA, Chicago, or Miami, where there's an incredible amount of density where neighbor response could be incredibly blazing fast versus full reliance on police or EMS. He emphasized that suburban neighbor response times won't be quite as low as urban apartment responses.

He encouraged us to continue having conversations compliant with the Mom Test to make sure that what we're designing or building matches untampered existing calmunity needs on a serious enough problem that exists that neighborhoods will bang down our door to get us to launch in their neighborhoods. 

He also pointed me / us to an interview with the NextDoor CEO on "How I Built This", suggesting that we could learn from the launch of NextDoor, or by implication partner with NextDoor to test and spread Neighbor911 to a few NextDoor calmunities.

# Local Fire Station Visit — Palm Beach County Fire Rescue Station 57

I visited my local fire station to discuss the Neighbor 911 proposal and received substantial, valuable feedback. While I won't use names, I'll reference station roles where relevant. I spoke primarily with the Station Chief, though station staff contributed insights and digital resources throughout, and the District Chief shared his perspective on where the boundary should fall between Neighbor 911 responder networks and professional Fire Rescue response.

---

## PulsePoint and Existing Emergency Response Apps

The Station Chief and staff recommended PulsePoint, an app enabling neighbors to respond to cardiac arrests. Its welcome screen reads: "PulsePoint: SAVE A LIFE: Get alerted to a nearby Sudden Cardiac Arrest so you can start CPR and find an AED in the critical minutes before first responders arrive."

PulsePoint is an excellent app that immediately addresses one of Neighbor 911's core requirements, yet it lacks sufficient popularity. Despite having over one million downloads, I'd never heard of it, and no one I've consulted has mentioned it. Given my commitment to lifesaving response, if I haven't encountered it, the app isn't reaching enough people.

### Questions About the PulsePoint Model

PulsePoint only sends CPR alerts for incidents in public places. Why exclude private homes? Perhaps because they receive alerts exclusively through 911 calls, creating no clear chain of permission or authority for responding neighbors to enter private residences. This suggests Neighbor 911 might need an opt-in system where property owners designate their homes as "enterable" or even "breakable" during verified emergencies—something PulsePoint hasn't addressed.

Corner cases exist, such as when a friend suffers an emergency at my house. If I haven't opted my property in but my friend's settings authorize entry or forced entry, the property owner's preferences should currently govern under the law. An exception might arise if a responder defends breaking and entering on religious freedom emergency rescue grounds—a challenging case that would likely depend on specific circumstances regarding the emergency's nature.

PulsePoint also restricts alerts to 0.25 or 0.50 mile radii, with local official rescue communities (typically fire districts) setting the distance. Different radii likely attenuate response density in urban and suburban areas while extending reach in rural areas with longer average response times. As administrative procedure, this system works reasonably well, allowing local communities to tune response radii to local conditions quickly and cost-effectively.

PulsePoint succeeds in continuously monitoring location in the background and alerting responders wherever they are—excellent engineering. I haven't yet experienced a PulsePoint alert but hope to in coming months.

Should Neighbor 911 reproduce independent versions of PulsePoint features using a more open-source model? We may need to wrestle with that decision. PulsePoint lacks categories I believe are essential, such as bedroom consent conflicts that Safeword requires.

### Incentives for Response

We discussed incentives for neighbors to respond during inconvenient times—at night, on date night, during important events, or during workdays—to sustain high-quality emergency response rates. I asked whether incentives would strengthen the community or undermine intrinsic civic motivations for emergency response.

The consensus was that this question exceeds fire station expertise and requires testing or decision-making (and funding) at a different community level. Staff mentioned Amphibious Medics, an app for off-duty emergency service workers that provides incentives for responding to local events.

---

## Specific Emergency Scenarios

### Drowning Rescue

We agree that not all drowning rescues are safe for non-lifeguards. However, I argue that many scenarios exist—particularly shallow-water situations involving small children in Florida home pools—where someone with amateur swimming ability (like myself) could readily save a struggling child or infant if alerted in time through camera-based AI or Neighbor 911 network alerts. In shallow water, even larger adults might be rescuable. Open water and canals present different challenges, though strong swimmers and especially former lifeguards might still be capable of saving someone in dangerous situations.

### Fire Rescue

The District Chief and Station Chief emphasized strongly that it's extremely dangerous and unwise to consider whether Neighbor 911 responders are brave enough to enter a burning building, even believing children are inside. Such attempts likely produce additional suffering—untrained responders becoming smoke inhalation victims trapped in the building. Moreover, opening doors could oxygenate fires with paradoxical effects, complicating professional rescue efforts. Reports of children inside could also prove false, meaning neighbors might suffer burns or smoke inhalation and potentially die for nothing.

The same applies to car crash rescue, especially involving fire—extremely high risk situations where professional fire rescue wants control without encouraging bystander intervention.

I suggested deploying Neighbor 911 responders as witnesses to house fires, allowing close neighbors to make their own determinations based on evolving knowledge and delay until fire services arrive. They felt this approach—waking formerly sleeping neighbors to calculate how brave or reckless to be in rescue attempts—was a recipe for disaster. These decisions should remain with specialized fire professionals who understand rapid survival calculations.

Hearing this, I recognized my relative ignorance about these choices and stated I wouldn't involve Neighbor 911 in active fire rescue.

### Other Medical Emergencies

We discussed cardiac arrest rescue and choking alongside drowning.

The chiefs noted that a central office headquarters in West Palm Beach handles larger strategic decisions. Palm Beach County frequently makes fire rescue decisions at the county level.

---

## Notable Statistics and Best Practices

Seattle reportedly has the country's highest resuscitation rate—a notable, trackable statistic worth investigating deeply. Why are they so positively deviant on bystander and neighbor resuscitation success? This is measured as survival to hospital discharge of Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA). No reason exists why other US areas with comparable neighbor-to-neighbor proximity shouldn't match, compete with, or exceed Seattle's rates. Urban density may contribute, but many cities are dense.

Separating witnessed versus unwitnessed out of hospital cardiac arrest statistics seems necessary, and future metrics should distinguish between "barrier," "break and enter," and "free entry" Neighbor 911 response categories.

---

## Topics Not Yet Covered

I didn't ask about handling forced entry in respiratory compromise cases—I need to return soon to discuss this with the Station Chief. It's a very difficult key topic.

I didn't discuss hosting drone-delivered AEDs. The dream scenario: a 911 call triggers Neighbor 911 alerts, AED drone dispatch, and EMS response simultaneously. Two neighbors perform CPR, sharing the load and ensuring high-quality compression and rescue breaths, while a third neighbor awaits the AED. Ideally, the AED is applied before emergency services arrive, though EMS takes over professionally upon arrival.

If only two neighbors arrive quickly, should they focus exclusively on CPR, or should one administer CPR while the other waits for the AED drone? Alternatively, should both focus on CPR and rescue breaths while EMS handles defibrillation upon arrival?

I didn't detail major UI choices, design libraries, or user narratives and flows, including whether to assist with intelligent SMS-to-911 text message generation or consistently direct sufferers toward immediate 911 PSAP calls even for lower-grade emergencies. For now, assume all emergency calls route through 911, with 911 PSAP activating Neighbor 911 as a minute-responder network.

---

## Missed Opportunities

I failed to share neighbor911.us with station personnel or ask if they'd participate in community discussion servers or comment on design specs, requirements, and user stories. Their feedback on my questions helps directly and indirectly, but continuous expert input on our communication channels during community proposal, design, and engineering would be far more valuable—to the extent they have spare time.

Additionally, major design choices require community leadership and debate. Significant "technical/schema lock-in" (as Jaron Lanier discusses in "You Are Not A Gadget") could create one-way door decisions regarding how much we push everyone toward 911 and how we parallelize voice AI, SMS-to-911, topic tap, and text entry for incident reporters while critical seconds tick away.

The conversation covered even more ground, but I regrettably failed to take real-time notes on my computer. I relied on conversational memory, which has limits, especially given my sometimes poor recall.

---

## Footnote: PulsePoint Terms of Service

PulsePoint's terms and conditions require users to agree not to "reverse engineer," "attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof."

These terms create problems for me. I want to catalyze an open-source alternative to PulsePoint. Simultaneously, I have strong civic and religious duty to sign up immediately for their app so I can save neighbors' lives. This moral double bind means I'm obliged both to sign up for PulsePoint and to refrain from learning how they solved the problem.

My resolution: signing up is obligatory, but I'll respect their design choices and intellectual property while finding different ways to solve similar underlying problems. This "anti-reverse engineer" contract pattern proves problematic for engineers, designers, and entrepreneurs working on civic or religious projects at conventional or post-conventional moral levels.

I copied their terms of service for future reference. I would have agreed to virtually any shrinkwrap agreement to fulfill my lifesaving duty.


Friday and Saturday, November 15-16, 2025 
=========================================
Here's a brief summary of takeaways from conversations.

- Minute responders are "first first responders", minutemen and minutewomen who arrive as neighbors on scene even before ambulance, fire, or police. Explaining that Neighbor 911™ organizes 1st First Responders who may be amateurs but can still be pivotal in many emergency moments is a simple way of explaining the key ingredient to the service.
- For those that know of United Hatzalah, this project is essentially a massive democratization and decentralization of the Hatzalah ethos of 90 second response times. We should definitely restart attempts to partner with United Hatzalah and other Emergency Response Organizations like Red Cross, who can help rapidly expand our mesh service grid not just locally but nationally and globally and fuel the initial service-market and product-market fit pilots in a few sample local calmunities.
- The idea for Hyperlocal Heartbeat Drills, Emergency Parties, and Know Thy Neighbor came from Sam Pevzner reacting to Shai G.'s focus and ideas and later conversations like Yashvi G. from India reminding us that lots of people don't know any or know few of their neighbors — many neighborhoods are missing the sense of neighborhood calmunity many people had years ago, see the studies in Bowling Alone. The "Know Thy Neighbor" meta-commandment is a distillation and outgrowth of those conversations and needs.
- Lots of really astute people key in on the liability concerns of this project, and fear how lawyers will fight over any high-stakes mistakes and mess-ups that might happen. Take a look at the Premortems to see the success and failure stories we face if lawyers get too adversarially and obstructively involved. While we have to heed and be concerned about liability, the Good Samaritan statutes in each locality should cover everything we'll be doing as long as we don't do anything too stupid, like encouraging users to go into burning buildings. There are neighborhood heroes who will do that but we can't do much to facilitate or encourage it, we have to caution people strongly against risking their lives and count on them to make a decision if dangerous heroism is nonetheless necessary, and in general Fire Departments warn that volunteer heroes frequently die or become disabled in fires unless they deeply understand and supercarefully calculate how to get in and out quickly with nothing worse than what happened to Cory Booker (second-degree burns, serious smoke inhalation injury). I imagine someday there will be dangerous or deadly mistakes by neighbors and we'll have to accept responsibility for what happened and make sure it never happens again. My hope is that the rescue number will so overwhelmingly overway the mishap count by that point that we'll be able to mourn and grow through the failure without it causing a calmunal collapse or causing us to throw the baby out with the bathwater. And I hope we can move at lightning speed in the meantime, moving fast and fixing things.
- I had several more conversations about reaction policy on safewords and safeword standardizations. It's fairly clear women want the ability to program and confirm a unique safeword only they know and they want the ability to trigger Safeword™ in a way that's not necessarily obtrusive and optionally covert hands-free. I've heard those points before from other women but this further codifies demand and needs in better organized fashion. I really hope women (and men) are willing to pay $20 to equip their beds with silent alarm buttons, just as an additional supportive safety standard, or be willing to purchase Loris SOS, Invisiwear, or other hardware efforts for better covert mechanical support if a sufferer wants to go the quiet, silent alarm route instead of triggering a Safeword™ alarm directly by powers of voice with a standard safeword or a secret phrase.
- It’s evident that I don’t yet have a structured, scalable way to present Neighbor 911™ use cases across major demographic groups. My representation of the problem space is haphazard when I explain Neighbor 911™ in new first-time encounters. The initiative’s scenarios can be organized into several key clusters:
-- Emergency Response (ABC: Airway, Breathing, Circulation): Covers crises such as opioid overdose, drowning, cardiac arrest, heart attack or stroke, anaphylactic shock, and severe asthma attacks.
-- Wellness & Safety Checks: Encompasses situations like serious falls among the elderly, consent-related conflicts (mild to severe, detected via mechanical or safeword triggers), suicide risk detection and prevention (through mental health professionals, family, friends, or hotlines), red-flag alerts, emergency witness services, and bystander interventions.
-- Violence Interruption: Focuses on de-escalating intense or potentially violent disputes, facilitating face-saving gestures, and enabling cautious but rapid responses to domestic violence threats.
-- Lifesaving Information Distribution: Disseminating essential public-safety and first-aid information rapidly and reliably across communities.
-- Voluntary Calmunity & Civic Action: Mobilizing neighbors for preventive and social good—supporting people in addiction recovery, organizing “dissuader flash mobs” to steer youth away from brain-injuring sports toward safer, skill-building activities, promoting community fitness and exercise-buddy programs, and aiding health systems in delivering critical vaccination or public-health campaigns. This cluster also fosters a shared sense of civigious democracy, where collective readiness and informed participation become expressions of community care.
- There are a lot of demographies I haven't spoken to enough yet, including the elderly and homeowners on the question of digital locks hardware installations / upgrades or breaking and entering or limited key code or key share by responding neighbor μcalmunity in an emergency. It's a sensitive question I don't have enough conversations on yet.
- My close friend Kleanthis wins the Best Critic Award so far, from an unreported conversation I had last Thursday, Nov 13th with him. He urged me to privilege privacy concerns much higher, arguing that the balance of security and privacy will grow dangerously off if breaking and entering is a "feature" of and encouraged as an emergency practice by the app without lots of very explicit property-owner opt-in permissions and very careful emergency management, and even then he said he might rather die than have someone break in under a Neighbor 911™ alert to his private home. He doesn't want a smart doorlock that can be unlocked without his permission by a hostile black hat or criminal. He doesn't want his doorlock to be networked or attached to the internet. What happens if there's a data breach and Neighbor 911™ holds key codes or key generation permissions for hundreds or hundreds of thousands of houses? He also stressed the risk of things like howeowner Castle Doctrine (a US legal position frequently construed where homeowners can freely kill perceived home invaders in fear of their life and ask questions later) lethal gunfire and a good samaritan first first responder getting killed if, say, someone fraudulently and falsely swats a property on Neighbor 911™ and the homeowner wants to defend their property from home invasion. He argued Neighbor 911™ is intercessing in emergencies without the uniformed authority that authority figures bring to the moment, and without that authority there could be chaotic messes, and a first first responder can make some bad situations worse. Note, it wasn't that Kleanthis thought this problem space is futile or intractable; he just thought there are a lot of toxic side reactions that might occur without great care and prior risk planning and awareness, and he wanted to advise caution before we start charging toward things like medical emergency breaking and entering. I'll have to make it a focus topic in the next few days to talk to more people about medical emergency entering and breaking and entering for different levels and layers of Neighbor 911™ μcalmunity. Maybe, for instance, people will say generally that breaking and entering by a unknown stranger is never acceptable, but that in a medical emergency reported to and authenticated as best as possible by Neighbor 911™ we'll accept and welcome by social convention known neighbors who respond to Heartbeat Drills and that we know from our μcalmunity Emergency Parties to not just enter but even break and enter. I don't even know the fundamentals of how EMS/police/fire handle entrance ethics and door breach in medically life-threatening or volatile emergency gradients. 
- I'm hoping others find their way toward Best Critic Award roles. I really appreciate constructive critics and criticism. It helps us remain very aware of potential risks and corner cases so we can find solutions and risk reductions for those problems before they risk tanking parts of the project design or strictly limiting the calmunity service ceiling we can reach. 

- I'm sorry, there were a lot more conversations that weren't properly logged. I'll get better about writing up conversations and interviews, especially those that are useful, unique, or very important.

Sunday, November 16, 2025
=========================
- I spoke to one elderly gentleman who said, when asked if he'd want someone to break into his house to save his life in a medical emergency, that he'd be ok with that. But he emphasized that he's only one person and that he's different than the general population, and that opinions on his may differ. He directed me to AI to discuss the question; I replied that I thought AI was likely to be undertrained on this as it's a bit of a novel question AI wouldn't have much cause to know well in the Neighbor 911™ context.

Tomasz
------
I met a product manager who had some great ideas for the flow of the project. Here's how I memorialized the conversation after in a follow-up message to him:


"I really like your idea of jumping from app geohash to multiband SMS+ alerting, using the app to passively poll location but using other technologies, whatever works best psychologically, to grab and guarantee immediate attention. On that, if they have the app installed anyway, I think app alerts will be cheaper and theoretically louder and more in-your-face as needed in an emergency, able even to wake someone up if permitted, but SMS has strong merits too for subacute emergencies or to alternatively alert and reinforce immediate attention-on-task in an acute emergency where you're one of the closest nearby responders. 

The idea on Wifi network geolocation matching is also pretty interesting... I've got to change the requested entitlements on the iOS app to include Wifi network names so we can have the option, in theory, of trying to cross-match wifi network info to further discern and improve first first responder proximity and priority. I didn't realize until we spoke that Wifi network polling might help pin down where people are in relation to each other and who's the best responder."

TODO: These ideas above need to get reincorporated into the design specs and roadmap.

AED Review at Dentist Office
----------------------------


On Duty Police Officer at Boca Raton City Council Meeting
-------------------------------------------------
Talked to a police officer at a Boca Raton City Council Meeting. He was extremely helpful in describing situations that he's been in. 

He expressed concern about how conflicts involving any level of physical force or anger like bedroom consent conflicts might possibly spiral, depending on how they're handled and what kind of training and scripts neighbors would have in responding to a Safeword™ or similar call. 

On medical emergencies, he explained that police cars, since they're already on the road, and perhaps also because they're more numerous, typically arrive faster at the scene of a serious medical emergency than fire, fire ambulance, or ambulance. It's through police that you're currently most likely to get Narcan/naloxone, 

He suggested, among other things, key access options for police so that they don't necessarily have to break through a window or break down a door (which requires more equipment). He explained that it would be super-helpful for a neighbor or family member to be there with a key on hand or with the door open ready for them to jump in and start CPR, even if they refuse or fail for any reason to do CPR themselves.
He also said he was very worried about any kind of service where key code information or hidden key location information was stored digitally, as he fears what would happen if hackers could break in to the service or if there were any kind of data leak, as that could cause tens of thousands or worse of damage to homes that had a breakin. We talked about it — I think some home owners or apartments would feel comfortable sharing, under some conditions, some kind of "break glass" emergency key code, but we could also primarily promote a social service where you have, say, 3-4 trusted neighbors with your key or key code and we, in an emergency, hammer call those neighbors and organize them to be ready to hand over the key code and key to the first first responder, even if it means, say, waking them up at night to get the key into position and the door unlocked without damage in a medical emergency. You'd have your trusted neighbors verify that the request was a serious one and that the first first responder was there under Neighbor 911 / 119 / 112 / SOS direction, and that social verification would help lockout potential feared thievery or abuse from the always present hacking risk. We can't, after all, guarantee even with perfect current security practices, which is frankly unlikely for us to get perfectly 100% right, that our cryptography will withstand more extreme foreseeable situations like quantum supremacy attacks that will melt everyone's digital secrets. 

I'm afraid I again failed to note down all his insights immediately after the convensation, so I may be failing to document a detail or several that are important that's not still in mind. I must get better at writing postmortems immediately after having substantive conversations about the Neighbor 911/119/112/999/000/etc. SOS Network.

He refocused me repeatedly on the access key support service neighbors could provide — he made it superclear that for police that's a huge help, perhaps the largest immediate thing he sees a instant strong need for the right neighbors on scene to step up and help with in their ordinary calls for which digital coordination would be super-useful. 

Again, he was more hesitant about neighbor involvement in any kind of volatile situation. Specifically for instance with Safeword he felt like the knowledge that a police officer was on the way might, in a small number of cases, make a person feel like they had nothing to lose by escalating and even perhaps taking a hostage rather than apologizing and cooperating very thoroughly and fully. Of course, police see the worst of the worst, they're called today most frequently in emergency mode only for the rarest and most violent cases of bedroom consent conflict rather than Red Lights that turn out to be Soft and Softer Red Lights, and they're especially risk-aware and risk-averse when it comes to how confrontations can spin out over the length of their careers. My personal belief is still that many confrontations can be interrupted by neighbors serving as calm examples, outside witnesses, and violence interruptors like they do in programs pioneered at least in part in Chicago. But even amateur neighbors can bring a pair of eyes to bear on a problem that can benefit from stabilization from an outside voice. 

I think to talk with police officers and others concerned about violent outbursts more productively about the Neighbor XYZ SOS Service, it'll be helpful to get Veo3 AI videos together to script out what I imagine these calls typically could or will look like, and we can debate whether that's a realistic and prosocial common calmunity flow we can run through when there's very serious conflict pushing past 1st Amendment protections or very antisocial harassing or violent behavior. With case examples, it'll be easier to debate and raise questions about what role Neighbor XYZ 911/119/112/999/000/etc. SOS  can play in changing the emergency from an epic disaster to a survivable event by arriving with great speed over great skill, with very reasonably achievable quick training / certification and a dose of wisdom and common sense.

Restaurant Hostess and fellow diner waiting for meal
-----------------------------------------------------
I sat next to a woman who was waiting for a pick up order like me and started talking with her. I told her I wondered whether restaurant workers were trained in CPR to treat any customers who may suffer cardiac arrest. We spend a lot of time collectively in restaurants — it would be very nice to know that even in an empty restaurant the staff would be ready and able to leap into action and start administering CPR chest compressions while dialing 911/119/112/999/000/etc. SOS with no more than 15 seconds unresponsiveness and abnormal none or agonal) breathing observation hesitation. Seriously, less than 15 seconds, as far as I can tell that's all it takes. 

The hostess said neither she nor anyone in the restaurant had CPR training to her knowledge. It's not required under Florida law, not even to a minimal, once-at-hire and once-every-four-or-five-year level. She also said there was a poster in the back about how to treat choking but she didn't go through any special training for that or physical experiences to practice the Heimlich maneuver, and didn't think anyone else at the restaurant did either. I find that incredibly frustrating, because it's very reasonable for the State of Florida to impose a requirement that restaurants only offer opening hours if they can reliably treat cardiac arrest, choking, and food allergy or other anaphylaxis if someone gets a surprising peanut exposure or other food allergen in their food. And if restaurant workers everyhwere in the State of Florida were actually well-trained in CPR, etc., that would be a great Neighbor 911/119/112/999/000/etc. SOS base layer of professionalism, since people with restaurant and such service sector work experience (ex: retail, etc. etc.) are so incredibly numerous in every State, locality, and nation, and can be a core strong part of the Neighbor 112/SOS/etc. "Corps" responding to such neighbor emergency events, even late at night in venues where people actually spend the most of their time outside past dark.

She also couldn't identify the nearest AED, which doesn't strike me as surprising or unusual — even I, as recently as a few days ago, didn't know where the nearest AED was from my home.

Thursday, November 18, 2025
==========================
I visited my local calmunity synagogue to find the nearest AED I've been told there is from where our neighborhood calmunity is. They had two AEDs, one on each side of the building, but they were not completely maintained and they were not consistently prepared, packed, or maintained. I had a chance to talk to Operations; they said they'd get on top of it as soon as possible.

Sunday, November 23, 2025
=========================
Today I attended a Basic Life Support course to get BLS certified, the first effective layer of calmunity⁶ emergency life-preserving response currently offered and endorsed by the American Heart and Stroke Association. The focus of the course was on CPR, AED use, and choking response; its content is well-documented, at least in summary form, online.

My [unstructured, unreedited notes from the session are public here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m_PhdVGWe6hZiU9ydRtJ8_uF317Vk2OV_WxshMMgBP4/edit?usp=sharing); warning: if you check them, they're very, very rough and unfinished. 

I'm worried about societal costs. The course cost $64.95 to attend and required the purchase of a $16.80 book supplement for refreshing and staying current on the course over the time to come until my next course recertification. I don't like how expensive this was for significant calmunity⁵ scaling, especially through the length of a person's lifetime with repeated certifications for 50 years coming to about $1,625 USD at that price, unless for instance in paying a rate as high as $64.95 I were to get a very small, private group training experience from a trainer as masterful as this one. 

There were roughly 20 people, I'd guess (I'm afraid I didn't count) present for training, so the company would have made revenue of maybe $1,299 before costs and taxes on that were applied, but just guesstimating ChatGPT is guessing gross profit was about $500-$900 between us, with realistic after-tax profit of $350 - $750. I really appreciate the importance of profit, it's a very core engine of progress, but in this domain where cost barriers reduce calmunity education levels on emergency life-preserving Naybor SOS™ and PulsePoint™ volunteer services I don't want the profits that come from charging such a high entry rate to serve as a cost barrier to the entire calmunity getting certified in BLS, to pull up our emergency survival rate and supplement and facilitate the work of our investments in emergency response. I'm not even sure if I would have been willing to pay $64.95 for BLS certification a few weeks ago, before I started laboring on Naybor 911™ and learned or was reminded of as much as I know now; that's the kind of price you'd charge to a captive audience that through occupational regulatory pressure must pay those rates, with smaller batches of trainees from insufficient, weak, undriven national demand for the course. If we drive demand up for the course and keep trainers as busy as I know they want to be, we can surely bend down the unit costs of training to the point where a calmunity⁵ can just cover the cost for everyone local.

 During the training session, there was one student who was not performing up to the standard that the instructor expected and needed for her or him to perform at, and at one point  an argument broke out about training standards and the expectations of excellence that  must be enforced within the course. The student was not a great fit for the work that day,  and she'll need to get recertified. The trainer was not able to complete her certification,  and I think that it's a great thing that not everyone is certified; that standards are kept high in basic life support training. Notably, everyone else passed — it's a very achievable certification if you're attentive and train your muscle memory. I myself failed too frequently in tilting back the head of  the mannequin that we were training with, when performing rescue breaths. It's something that I  need to keep in mind carefully. The trainer was willing to let me pass with my experience and with repeated efforts to fix that flaw in my behavior. It's something that I'm gonig to have to remain aware of whenever a crisis happens because it's a detail that I am likely to forget in an emergency if I'm not careful, and it could kill someone if breath doesn't get past the tongue or an obstructed, kinked airway. Also, the conflict got so heated that I felt the need to interject with "Calm Down". No one else said anything, and I felt like what I said/interjected in an effort to get the lady to take a moment to rethink her approach was very suboptimal and ignored. So, that's the immediate, proximate origin of [Take 10](https://www.take10.us).

  It's going to be important for the BLS training community to keep really high standards.  If the BLS training system gets scaled up in the ways that I'm going to suggest later in this document,  the instructor that I had was very excellent.  But apparently there have been some scandals with instructors granting certification  without adequate training performance.  And it would be great if the AHA and other community organizations do periodic testing or secret shopping  to make sure that the trainers who are performing this life-saving life-giving service  stay on their toes and fully train neighbors and providers in amazing emergency life support at the basic level.

 After the BLS training session, I and another student stayed back and we talked about the  program and program opportunities.  One of the several very useful ideas that came out of that conversation was the notion  that we can support community training of symptom or ethnic mission for the early symptoms  of cardiac hypoxia, specifically heart clots, by testing our friends and family on their  reaction when we describe early symptoms that are typical of cardiac distress, like saying,  oh, I have chest pain and seeing how someone around you reacts, whether they show concern,  immediate concern, and steady and strong concern, and whether they start arguing and advocating for  you to go to get a check with an EKG having felt that cluster of symptoms that is indicative  of the early phases of what could become a cardiac arrest if left untreated.  There were other types of scenarios and simulations that we could share in community public life,  like simulated collapses to see if bystanders actually jumped into a vein or whether they hang  back or, say, unhelpful things. To what degree people jump and rise at the occasion is something that  we can improve over time with simulated experiences like that and neighbor SOS may be able to help  by coordinating with local emergency departments to put up a geofence, a small geofence, somewhere where  a simulation like this might happen so that the local community emergency centers don't get confused  if people in the immediate area dial 911 rapidly in order to react to that situation.  So it would be very nice if we could have, if we could reach that level of development where  we have a community network that is constantly training and testing with one another,  not every day, not every month, but frequently enough so that we see  cardiac arrest experiences and we hear the early stages of cardiac tissue death and the symptoms of  that enough so that we know how to respond to it and respond to it on behalf of our neighbor's  family and friends and stay sharp. And whenever we perform "Lifesaver Army Drama" tests like that with friends, family, and calmunity⁵, we can and should of course demarcate it as a test as soon as we can without negating the supportive testing experience and explain to people immediately once we differentiate noble response from ignoble reaction that it was a test and that we were acting as standardized patient. Without that kind of stimulated training and experience it becomes too low of a frequency of event for people to instinctively react to extremely well and people don't always know how to jump in an intervene and to do so bravely and confidently when the need arises. We should have ro (zero) or very close to ro bystander hesitation in nayborhoods, not refusal or killer injurious hesitation to start chest compression from 1 in 2 United States residents who witness such an arrest. And there are a lot of other situations where Lifesavers Army Drama can "behaviorally immunize" our populations effectively to rise to the occasion when a real serious event happens, like a quickly spiraling argument without face-saving gestures, a calmness offramp, or apology that's getting too far out of control. I don't yet know what the preferred strategy for heated argument response should be, but it's something I'll be thinking about; I didn't know what I could do when the instructor and the student broke out into quite heated argument to help aside from saying, "Calm down". Perhaps, with better training and testing, I'd learn to say, "Take 10", in the sense of take 10 seconds, 10 minutes, or 10 hours, then get back to it, ideally with mutual humility, mutual honesty, and a problem-solving attitude. But if you need to, you can always take just 10 seconds and then get back to the heated argument if your principles are deeply at stake, the problem is worth the rage, and that's your speech and argument style. I'm not proposing that Take 10 be used to quench all anger — a lot of times anger and confrontational argument is the right, noble, natural, and necessary path. But "Take 10", I'd think, would be a very natural kind of calmunity⁵ tool to reinforce to prompt reflection on whether the heat the argument or situation is generating is really necessary, noble, or natural, and a fast-acting deescalation pattern that could be a Lifesavers Army Drama exercise any catalytic volunteer can start building a Take 10 catalyst training around, teaching teachers how to teach and test Take 10 everywhere, on the understanding that all the world's a stage, and fights and conflicts that boil over can happen anywhere, and naybor bystanders needs to have something they can say that we can all tolerate to strongly suggest deescalation routine without triggering more escalation or hostility. Take 10, when it's the listener's freedom to interpret that as 10 seconds vs 10 minutes vs 10 hours, respects autonomy and gives everyone at least a brief chance to rethink.

Increasingly, I feel we need [a national training program for Basic Life Support similar to what other countries have pursued](https://github.com/LifesaverLabs/NayborSOS/blob/main/policy_proposals/free_national_bls_training/free_national_bls_training.md). If you want to see how we'd pay for such a program, [here are the predicted costs](https://github.com/LifesaverLabs/NayborSOS/blob/main/policy_proposals/free_national_bls_training/costs_free_national_bls_training.md). 

It's also insane and likely, on margin, a widowmaker that the book that the American Heart Association sells for BLS training costs an even further additive $16.80. Assuming a nonprofit model, at maximum the writing and research for such a book should be paid off with capped organizational profit and then distributed for free thereafter, to reduce artificial cost barriers to neighborhood training and ongoing refreshed best-practice memory of how to leap in in crises. It's hard to believe the AHA hasn't already made enough profit from early manual sales to the professional calmunity⁵ to switch it to a freely available internet resource, cutting $16.80 from the cost of nayborhood.org (please someone volunteer to help develop that site) training. Quite seriously, is the purpose of the American Heart Association to train as many Americans as possible in CPR/AED/Choking response with lowered cost barriers to BLS training or to pay [the AHA CEO's ridiculous $4.3 million dollar annual salary](https://www.heart.org/-/media/Annual-Report/2023-2024-Annual-Report-Files/2023_2024_IRS_Form_990.pdf?sc_lang=en), with her taking a salary over 10x higher than the US President? Again, I'm all for strong and free capitalistic systems, especially in markets where there isn't deep distress and duress and overwhelming unmet emergency needs showing deep, long-lasting free market service and systems design failure. But in this market, residents and citizens are failing to keep others alive in large part through the cost barriers the AHA is effectively endorsing on calmunity learning by charging $16.80 for this BLS Provider Manual eBook that's needed for staying fresh on the course. I have no doubt that AHA philanthropists would be happy to cover the cost of developing and delivering an ebook for free for Nayborhood trainees if that were asked of them. Me, I'd myself be willing to donate $100 or more to a buyer's pool of crowdsourced funds earmarked for eliminating the reproduction cost of the Basic BLS eBook accompaniment for the course to ro (zero) for all my Naybors, wherever they may live, wherever I may ever live or travel to. 

These notes may be modified in the future; they're likely to some extent incomplete as I'm rushing on to another priority: working to contact PulsePoint™ for partnership and shared aims. In the USA, they're a superkey partner; the nearest thing we have at the moment to Naybor SOS™ in the Basic Life Support domain.

I was lucky enough or serendipitous enough to see a Cintas truck outside my LA Fitness gym performing restocking. They have a AED provision and maintenance contract with LA Fitness. Sadly and tragically, the guy working was smoking, so I was morally compelled to talk with him about nicotine addiction quit motivation first, though I should have also spoken with him about my very short experience learning through personal experience about cigarette culture and more importantly too about "quit grit", how to sustain his next quit attempt. (I like the phrase "quit grit" in English – it turns quitting into a positively oriented resiliency test strengthening and reflecting a super-core virtue instead of into the mood of being "a quitter", which is, IMO, a very demotivating frame of reference – who wants to be a quitter? Open to other langauge on that for [Blessed/BLED Dialect or American, which I'm also trying to influence, however hard or slow](https://www.enoughisenuf.org)). I pointed him and would point anyone needing quit grit to [Tips from Former Smokers](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/index.html) ([this first-ranked site on that phrase](https://cancer-network.org/outlast-tobacco/) is also really good and motivating) and eventually had to stand several steps away from him to get out of his gag-causing fume plume. 

We had a great conversation otherwise about stocking and selling supplies for crisis response. He shared that Cintas does have some neighborhood contracts in my section of Florida, mostly with gated calmunities, to perform AED leasing and maintenance. I was surprised by that because in a previous conversation with Cintas customer support hotline they seemed to indicate they only served formal workplaces. He threw out a rough cost for AED provision and maintenance, though he referenced sales frequently to indicate that he didn't know the exact price, but he thought it might be in the neighborhood of $150/month (₹13,300/M, ¥1060/M, ¤€130/m, Rp2.5MM/M) for the AED and for regular checks and maintenance of the AED to guarantee everything's up to code and ready for use. I asked him if he [had any checklists or anything](https://search.worldcat.org/title/465378674) that helped ensure that the job of AED maintenance was done well each and every time, and said I'd love to take a photograph of any such checklist or guidance if I'm allowed, but he said he didn't have any checklists. (There's room for improvement there for Cintas if that's true.) We also talked more openly about what else he supplies, and he explained that they stock bleed kits and he showed me one. I regret that I didn't snap a photo; the box came with a nice external itemized label explainer of what was included that I haven't been able to find as well-labeled thru ecommerce yet. I asked him how people get trained to use the bleed management kit and he said bleed management training was provided by Cintas to customers equipped with such kits. There are some videos online I've found introducing bleed kits; I'm still looking for a great training video on bleeds. Then I asked him about whether they stock naloxone for opioid overdose, and he said they're starting to and that he's seen police departments more and more handing out naloxone for free to those who ask for it. That was like music to my ears; my last known understanding was that you'd need an addiction and a prescription from your doctor to get naloxone for free in most of the United States, even if your loved one or a naybor had an addiction I wasn't aware that you could get naloxone for free. I may not be up to date on the state of that program. It's not that expensive to buy naloxone if it's not bought for you by government for free in the context of American spending standards at around $30 USD (₹2600 INR, ¥210 RMB, €26 EUR, Rp500,000 IDR, etc.) but a lot of households even at that $30 level feel a very real barrier stocking it at home if they don't feel the immediate need to protect someone very close. Most won't spontaneously stock it just in case a naybor overdoses unless they know that naybor and have it in their focal attention that that nearest naybor could die if they're not ready with naloxone to save them. Many families, very frequently not even knowing their nearest naybors, let alone their next nearest naybors, don't stock up and then tragically only learn of their naybor's addiction when ambulances or a hearse appear in the nayborhood.

We also talked about AED cabinet quality. He explained that many external AED cabinets get damaged over time from sun and rain; that the right kind of AED cabinet is weatherproofed and costs somewhere in the nayborhood of $500 USD (₹44,600 INR, ¥3,500 RMB, €430 EUR, Rp8.3MM IDR, etc.) at market today, at least perhaps as sold thru Cintas. I've only seen the indoor alarmed cabinets, but yes, some of the cabinets I've seen for AEDs are pretty surprisingly or even shockingly expensive. It looks based on a quick glance online like you can get a basic AED-only indoor cabinet with a sound alarm (perhaps with not enuf room for calmfortable fit of a bleed kit, nalaxone, first aid supplies, etc.) for around $70 USD (₹6,200 INR, ¥500 RMB, €60 EUR, Rp1.1MM IDR, etc.), but outdoor cabinets are a lot more expensive. 

A general point: when I was opening my first "alarmed" AED cabinet to check what was inside and whether it was maintained, I didn't know if it was alarmed in the sense of being connected to a security company and SOS services or whether it was just going to make a noise or siren for the people I was nearby. At first, I was afraid to open a cabinet because I thought SOS (112/911/119/15/999/000, etc.) would be alerted and might send emergency responders. It turns out that most AED cabinets aren't networked to call or alert SOS, at least not yet, at least not in the US. So don't be too fearful of opening an AED cabinet to learn more about AEDs before an emergency and help confirm periodically that everything in your neighborhood's up to maintenance standards.
