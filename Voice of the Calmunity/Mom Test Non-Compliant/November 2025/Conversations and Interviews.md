Boca Raton Food Service Worker, Male 20s
----------------------------------------
Talked with worker at Chipotle, a tall male likely in his 20s. I told him a bit about the project and asked him if he would respond to a Naybor SOS call. At first he was uncertain and noncommittal, because the picture I had painted for him was a case of domestic violence, and it turned out he was fearful that he might be walking into a situation where there's a knife or a gun involved. But then I painted him a different picture, a more typical case, where there's a Safeword™ or similar bedroom consent conflict emergency where there's one person who's aroused and not listening or heeding boundaries and another who's in flight, fight, freeze, or fawn response. He changed his mind and said he probably would be happy to go and do a doorknock to keep anyone vulnerable safe in a situation like that.

I also talked to him about whether he felt it would be a good idea for us to offer reward incentives / interruption compensation of $18 or $36 for that kind of service. He felt like in the context of bedroom consent conflicts offering interruption compensation or rewards might interfere with civic and safety-focused motivation and might also draw out the wrong kinds of people for the wrong motives. He felt uncomfortable with the idea of being paid back $18 or $36 for interrupting a consent conflict. I asked him about another example, whether it would make sense to offer a reward bounty for a lost dog, to motivate people to keep their eyes out for and report or chase after a dog that was lost in the neighborhood. He reacted by saying that in that context rewards made a lot of sense to him as a way of promoting the sad situation to enough people's attention.

He was pretty excited by the project potential and wanted to confirm his memory of the name of the service, double checking that this project was called Naybor SOS. 

Boca Raton Teens, Two Males, 13 and ~15
----------------------------------
I had two young teen males asking me what code I was working on on my laptop, and I explained to them the fundamentals of Naybor SOS™. I said to the younger one, who was 13, that I thought he could keep someone alive with CPR; I thought he was likely old enough. He said he didn't know (he hasn't been trained yet), and the 15 year old confidently said he learned CPR in school and felt calmfortable doing CPR if necessary in an emergency.

I looked up age requirements for good-quality CPR after this conversation and the American Heart Association finds that 12+ year olds are generally capable of good-quality CPR with regular 2-inch depth chest compression. Younger than that many 10-12 year olds don't have the strength or body weight to achieve 2 inch chest compression. Persons who are age 15+ are generally fully equivalent to adults on sustained CPR chest compression for multiple minutes, with swapping with another rescuer.

<10 → Can help, call 911, use AED, maybe do shallow compressions
10–12 → Can perform CPR but may not consistently reach required depth, and may not be able to do rescue breaths
12–14 → Most can perform effective adult-quality CPR with rescue breaths
15+ → Equivalent to adults 

Boca Raton SCORE Mentor / Advisor
---------------------------------
Talked with a SCORE mentor about this pivot into launching an open source project for Naybor SOS™. He urged me to do a lot more interviews with people to figure out the voice of the calmunity and what people actually need, and whether there really is a need. He pointed out that in his gated calmunity, there's a security guard about a minute away from his house who could respond to an emergency if called. Naybor SOS™ could be valuable for him as a way of connecting him to his security guard in an emergency, but for him the 24/7 security guard he has within a minute's reach may be a suitable option for a lot of emergency response cases like choking or maybe even solitary rapid CPR.

He recommended focusing on a very small, local market at first, to achieve a sustained small two-sided market of sufferers (demand) and minute responders (supply) where demand and supply testing could begin and be sustained, ideally picking on a very dense urban center like New York City, LA, Chicago, or Miami, where there's an incredible amount of density where neighbor response could be incredibly blazing fast versus full reliance on police or EMS. He emphasized that suburban neighbor response times won't be quite as low as urban apartment responses.

He encouraged us to continue having conversations compliant with the Mom Test to make sure that what we're designing or building matches untampered existing calmunity needs on a serious enough problem that exists that neighborhoods will bang down our door to get us to launch in their neighborhoods. 

He also pointed me / us to an interview with the NextDoor CEO on "How I Built This", suggesting that we could learn from the launch of NextDoor, or by implication partner with NextDoor to test and spread Naybor SOS to a few NextDoor calmunities.

# Local Fire Station Visit — Palm Beach County Fire Rescue Station 57

I visited my local fire station to discuss the Naybor SOS proposal and received substantial, valuable feedback. While I won't use names, I'll reference station roles where relevant. I spoke primarily with the Station Chief, though station staff contributed insights and digital resources throughout, and the District Chief shared his perspective on where the boundary should fall between Naybor SOS responder networks and professional Fire Rescue response.

---

## PulsePoint and Existing Emergency Response Apps

The Station Chief and staff recommended PulsePoint, an app enabling neighbors to respond to cardiac arrests. Its welcome screen reads: "PulsePoint: SAVE A LIFE: Get alerted to a nearby Sudden Cardiac Arrest so you can start CPR and find an AED in the critical minutes before first responders arrive."

PulsePoint is an excellent app that immediately addresses one of Naybor SOS's core requirements, yet it lacks sufficient popularity. Despite having over one million downloads, I'd never heard of it, and no one I've consulted has mentioned it. Given my commitment to lifesaving response, if I haven't encountered it, the app isn't reaching enough people.

### Questions About the PulsePoint Model

PulsePoint only sends CPR alerts for incidents in public places. Why exclude private homes? Perhaps because they receive alerts exclusively through 911 calls, creating no clear chain of permission or authority for responding neighbors to enter private residences. This suggests Naybor SOS might need an opt-in system where property owners designate their homes as "enterable" or even "breakable" during verified emergencies—something PulsePoint hasn't addressed.

Corner cases exist, such as when a friend suffers an emergency at my house. If I haven't opted my property in but my friend's settings authorize entry or forced entry, the property owner's preferences should currently govern under the law. An exception might arise if a responder defends breaking and entering on religious freedom emergency rescue grounds—a challenging case that would likely depend on specific circumstances regarding the emergency's nature.

PulsePoint also restricts alerts to 0.25 or 0.50 mile radii, with local official rescue communities (typically fire districts) setting the distance. Different radii likely attenuate response density in urban and suburban areas while extending reach in rural areas with longer average response times. As administrative procedure, this system works reasonably well, allowing local communities to tune response radii to local conditions quickly and cost-effectively.

PulsePoint succeeds in continuously monitoring location in the background and alerting responders wherever they are—excellent engineering. I haven't yet experienced a PulsePoint alert but hope to in coming months.

Should Naybor SOS reproduce independent versions of PulsePoint features using a more open-source model? We may need to wrestle with that decision. PulsePoint lacks categories I believe are essential, such as bedroom consent conflicts that Safeword requires.

### Incentives for Response

We discussed incentives for neighbors to respond during inconvenient times—at night, on date night, during important events, or during workdays—to sustain high-quality emergency response rates. I asked whether incentives would strengthen the community or undermine intrinsic civic motivations for emergency response.

The consensus was that this question exceeds fire station expertise and requires testing or decision-making (and funding) at a different community level. Staff mentioned Amphibious Medics, an app for off-duty emergency service workers that provides incentives for responding to local events.

---

## Specific Emergency Scenarios

### Drowning Rescue

We agree that not all drowning rescues are safe for non-lifeguards. However, I argue that many scenarios exist—particularly shallow-water situations involving small children in Florida home pools—where someone with amateur swimming ability (like myself) could readily save a struggling child or infant if alerted in time through camera-based AI or Naybor SOS network alerts. In shallow water, even larger adults might be rescuable. Open water and canals present different challenges, though strong swimmers and especially former lifeguards might still be capable of saving someone in dangerous situations.

### Fire Rescue

The District Chief and Station Chief emphasized strongly that it's extremely dangerous and unwise to consider whether Naybor SOS responders are brave enough to enter a burning building, even believing children are inside. Such attempts likely produce additional suffering—untrained responders becoming smoke inhalation victims trapped in the building. Moreover, opening doors could oxygenate fires with paradoxical effects, complicating professional rescue efforts. Reports of children inside could also prove false, meaning neighbors might suffer burns or smoke inhalation and potentially die for nothing.

The same applies to car crash rescue, especially involving fire—extremely high risk situations where professional fire rescue wants control without encouraging bystander intervention.

I suggested deploying Naybor SOS responders as witnesses to house fires, allowing close neighbors to make their own determinations based on evolving knowledge and delay until fire services arrive. They felt this approach—waking formerly sleeping neighbors to calculate how brave or reckless to be in rescue attempts—was a recipe for disaster. These decisions should remain with specialized fire professionals who understand rapid survival calculations.

Hearing this, I recognized my relative ignorance about these choices and stated I wouldn't involve Naybor SOS in active fire rescue.

### Other Medical Emergencies

We discussed cardiac arrest rescue and choking alongside drowning.

The chiefs noted that a central office headquarters in West Palm Beach handles larger strategic decisions. Palm Beach County frequently makes fire rescue decisions at the county level.

---

## Notable Statistics and Best Practices

Seattle reportedly has the country's highest resuscitation rate—a notable, trackable statistic worth investigating deeply. Why are they so positively deviant on bystander and neighbor resuscitation success? This is measured as survival to hospital discharge of Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA). No reason exists why other US areas with comparable neighbor-to-neighbor proximity shouldn't match, compete with, or exceed Seattle's rates. Urban density may contribute, but many cities are dense.

Separating witnessed versus unwitnessed out of hospital cardiac arrest statistics seems necessary, and future metrics should distinguish between "barrier," "break and enter," and "free entry" Naybor SOS response categories.

---

## Topics Not Yet Covered

I didn't ask about handling forced entry in respiratory compromise cases—I need to return soon to discuss this with the Station Chief. It's a very difficult key topic.

I didn't discuss hosting drone-delivered AEDs. The dream scenario: a 911 call triggers Naybor SOS alerts, AED drone dispatch, and EMS response simultaneously. Two neighbors perform CPR, sharing the load and ensuring high-quality compression and rescue breaths, while a third neighbor awaits the AED. Ideally, the AED is applied before emergency services arrive, though EMS takes over professionally upon arrival.

If only two neighbors arrive quickly, should they focus exclusively on CPR, or should one administer CPR while the other waits for the AED drone? Alternatively, should both focus on CPR and rescue breaths while EMS handles defibrillation upon arrival?

I didn't detail major UI choices, design libraries, or user narratives and flows, including whether to assist with intelligent SMS-to-911 text message generation or consistently direct sufferers toward immediate 911 PSAP calls even for lower-grade emergencies. For now, assume all emergency calls route through 911, with 911 PSAP activating Naybor SOS as a minute-responder network.

---

## Missed Opportunities

I failed to share neighbor911.us with station personnel or ask if they'd participate in community discussion servers or comment on design specs, requirements, and user stories. Their feedback on my questions helps directly and indirectly, but continuous expert input on our communication channels during community proposal, design, and engineering would be far more valuable—to the extent they have spare time.

Additionally, major design choices require community leadership and debate. Significant "technical/schema lock-in" (as Jaron Lanier discusses in "You Are Not A Gadget") could create one-way door decisions regarding how much we push everyone toward 911 and how we parallelize voice AI, SMS-to-911, topic tap, and text entry for incident reporters while critical seconds tick away.

The conversation covered even more ground, but I regrettably failed to take real-time notes on my computer. I relied on conversational memory, which has limits, especially given my sometimes poor recall.

---

## Footnote: PulsePoint Terms of Service

PulsePoint's terms and conditions require users to agree not to "reverse engineer," "attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof."

These terms create problems for me. I want to catalyze an open-source alternative to PulsePoint. Simultaneously, I have strong civic and religious duty to sign up immediately for their app so I can save neighbors' lives. This moral double bind means I'm obliged both to sign up for PulsePoint and to refrain from learning how they solved the problem.

My resolution: signing up is obligatory, but I'll respect their design choices and intellectual property while finding different ways to solve similar underlying problems. This "anti-reverse engineer" contract pattern proves problematic for engineers, designers, and entrepreneurs working on civic or religious projects at conventional or post-conventional moral levels.

I copied their terms of service for future reference. I would have agreed to virtually any shrinkwrap agreement to fulfill my lifesaving duty.


Friday and Saturday, November 15-16, 2025 
=========================================
Here's a brief summary of takeaways from conversations.

- Minute responders are "first first responders", minutemen and minutewomen who arrive as neighbors on scene even before ambulance, fire, or police. Explaining that Naybor SOS™ organizes 1st First Responders who may be amateurs but can still be pivotal in many emergency moments is a simple way of explaining the key ingredient to the service.
- For those that know of United Hatzalah, this project is essentially a massive democratization and decentralization of the Hatzalah ethos of 90 second response times. We should definitely restart attempts to partner with United Hatzalah and other Emergency Response Organizations like Red Cross, who can help rapidly expand our mesh service grid not just locally but nationally and globally and fuel the initial service-market and product-market fit pilots in a few sample local calmunities.
- The idea for Hyperlocal Heartbeat Drills, Emergency Parties, and Know Thy Neighbor came from Sam Pevzner reacting to Shai G.'s focus and ideas and later conversations like Yashvi G. from India reminding us that lots of people don't know any or know few of their neighbors — many neighborhoods are missing the sense of neighborhood calmunity many people had years ago, see the studies in Bowling Alone. The "Know Thy Neighbor" meta-commandment is a distillation and outgrowth of those conversations and needs.
- Lots of really astute people key in on the liability concerns of this project, and fear how lawyers will fight over any high-stakes mistakes and mess-ups that might happen. Take a look at the Premortems to see the success and failure stories we face if lawyers get too adversarially and obstructively involved. While we have to heed and be concerned about liability, the Good Samaritan statutes in each locality should cover everything we'll be doing as long as we don't do anything too stupid, like encouraging users to go into burning buildings. There are neighborhood heroes who will do that but we can't do much to facilitate or encourage it, we have to caution people strongly against risking their lives and count on them to make a decision if dangerous heroism is nonetheless necessary, and in general Fire Departments warn that volunteer heroes frequently die or become disabled in fires unless they deeply understand and supercarefully calculate how to get in and out quickly with nothing worse than what happened to Cory Booker (second-degree burns, serious smoke inhalation injury). I imagine someday there will be dangerous or deadly mistakes by neighbors and we'll have to accept responsibility for what happened and make sure it never happens again. My hope is that the rescue number will so overwhelmingly overway the mishap count by that point that we'll be able to mourn and grow through the failure without it causing a calmunal collapse or causing us to throw the baby out with the bathwater. And I hope we can move at lightning speed in the meantime, moving fast and fixing things.
- I had several more conversations about reaction policy on safewords and safeword standardizations. It's fairly clear women want the ability to program and confirm a unique safeword only they know and they want the ability to trigger Safeword™ in a way that's not necessarily obtrusive and optionally covert hands-free. I've heard those points before from other women but this further codifies demand and needs in better organized fashion. I really hope women (and men) are willing to pay $20 to equip their beds with silent alarm buttons, just as an additional supportive safety standard, or be willing to purchase Loris SOS, Invisiwear, or other hardware efforts for better covert mechanical support if a sufferer wants to go the quiet, silent alarm route instead of triggering a Safeword™ alarm directly by powers of voice with a standard safeword or a secret phrase.
- It’s evident that I don’t yet have a structured, scalable way to present Naybor SOS™ use cases across major demographic groups. My representation of the problem space is haphazard when I explain Naybor SOS™ in new first-time encounters. The initiative’s scenarios can be organized into several key clusters:
-- Emergency Response (ABC: Airway, Breathing, Circulation): Covers crises such as opioid overdose, drowning, cardiac arrest, heart attack or stroke, anaphylactic shock, and severe asthma attacks.
-- Wellness & Safety Checks: Encompasses situations like serious falls among the elderly, consent-related conflicts (mild to severe, detected via mechanical or safeword triggers), suicide risk detection and prevention (through mental health professionals, family, friends, or hotlines), red-flag alerts, emergency witness services, and bystander interventions.
-- Violence Interruption: Focuses on de-escalating intense or potentially violent disputes, facilitating face-saving gestures, and enabling cautious but rapid responses to domestic violence threats.
-- Lifesaving Information Distribution: Disseminating essential public-safety and first-aid information rapidly and reliably across communities.
-- Voluntary Calmunity & Civic Action: Mobilizing neighbors for preventive and social good—supporting people in addiction recovery, organizing “dissuader flash mobs” to steer youth away from brain-injuring sports toward safer, skill-building activities, promoting community fitness and exercise-buddy programs, and aiding health systems in delivering critical vaccination or public-health campaigns. This cluster also fosters a shared sense of civigious democracy, where collective readiness and informed participation become expressions of community care.
- There are a lot of demographies I haven't spoken to enough yet, including the elderly and homeowners on the question of digital locks hardware installations / upgrades or breaking and entering or limited key code or key share by responding neighbor μcalmunity in an emergency. It's a sensitive question I don't have enough conversations on yet.
- My close friend Kleanthis wins the Best Critic Award so far, from an unreported conversation I had last Thursday, Nov 13th with him. He urged me to privilege privacy concerns much higher, arguing that the balance of security and privacy will grow dangerously off if breaking and entering is a "feature" of and encouraged as an emergency practice by the app without lots of very explicit property-owner opt-in permissions and very careful emergency management, and even then he said he might rather die than have someone break in under a Naybor SOS™ alert to his private home. He doesn't want a smart doorlock that can be unlocked without his permission by a hostile black hat or criminal. He doesn't want his doorlock to be networked or attached to the internet. What happens if there's a data breach and Naybor SOS™ holds key codes or key generation permissions for hundreds or hundreds of thousands of houses? He also stressed the risk of things like howeowner Castle Doctrine (a US legal position frequently construed where homeowners can freely kill perceived home invaders in fear of their life and ask questions later) lethal gunfire and a good samaritan first first responder getting killed if, say, someone fraudulently and falsely swats a property on Naybor SOS™ and the homeowner wants to defend their property from home invasion. He argued Naybor SOS™ is intercessing in emergencies without the uniformed authority that authority figures bring to the moment, and without that authority there could be chaotic messes, and a first first responder can make some bad situations worse. Note, it wasn't that Kleanthis thought this problem space is futile or intractable; he just thought there are a lot of toxic side reactions that might occur without great care and prior risk planning and awareness, and he wanted to advise caution before we start charging toward things like medical emergency breaking and entering. I'll have to make it a focus topic in the next few days to talk to more people about medical emergency entering and breaking and entering for different levels and layers of Naybor SOS™ μcalmunity. Maybe, for instance, people will say generally that breaking and entering by a unknown stranger is never acceptable, but that in a medical emergency reported to and authenticated as best as possible by Naybor SOS™ we'll accept and welcome by social convention known neighbors who respond to Heartbeat Drills and that we know from our μcalmunity Emergency Parties to not just enter but even break and enter. I don't even know the fundamentals of how EMS/police/fire handle entrance ethics and door breach in medically life-threatening or volatile emergency gradients. 
- I'm hoping others find their way toward Best Critic Award roles. I really appreciate constructive critics and criticism. It helps us remain very aware of potential risks and corner cases so we can find solutions and risk reductions for those problems before they risk tanking parts of the project design or strictly limiting the calmunity service ceiling we can reach. 

- I'm sorry, there were a lot more conversations that weren't properly logged. I'll get better about writing up conversations and interviews, especially those that are useful, unique, or very important.

Sunday, November 16, 2025
=========================
- I spoke to one elderly gentleman who said, when asked if he'd want someone to break into his house to save his life in a medical emergency, that he'd be ok with that. But he emphasized that he's only one person and that he's different than the general population, and that opinions on his may differ. He directed me to AI to discuss the question; I replied that I thought AI was likely to be undertrained on this as it's a bit of a novel question AI wouldn't have much cause to know well in the Naybor SOS™ context.

Tomasz
------
I met a product manager who had some great ideas for the flow of the project. Here's how I memorialized the conversation after in a follow-up message to him:


"I really like your idea of jumping from app geohash to multiband SMS+ alerting, using the app to passively poll location but using other technologies, whatever works best psychologically, to grab and guarantee immediate attention. On that, if they have the app installed anyway, I think app alerts will be cheaper and theoretically louder and more in-your-face as needed in an emergency, able even to wake someone up if permitted, but SMS has strong merits too for subacute emergencies or to alternatively alert and reinforce immediate attention-on-task in an acute emergency where you're one of the closest nearby responders. 

The idea on Wifi network geolocation matching is also pretty interesting... I've got to change the requested entitlements on the iOS app to include Wifi network names so we can have the option, in theory, of trying to cross-match wifi network info to further discern and improve first first responder proximity and priority. I didn't realize until we spoke that Wifi network polling might help pin down where people are in relation to each other and who's the best responder."

TODO: These ideas above need to get reincorporated into the design specs and roadmap.

AED Review at Dentist Office

On Duty Police Officer at Boca Raton City Council Meeting
-------------------------------------------------
Talked to a police officer at a Boca Raton City Council Meeting. He was extremely helpful in describing situations that he's been in. 

He expressed concern about how conflicts involving any level of physical force or anger like bedroom consent conflicts might possibly spiral, depending on how they're handled and what kind of training and scripts neighbors would have in responding to a Safeword™ or similar call. 

On medical emergencies, he explained that police cars, since they're already on the road, and perhaps also because they're more numerous, typically arrive faster at the scene of a serious medical emergency than fire, fire ambulance, or ambulance. It's through police that you're currently most likely to get Narcan/naloxone, 

He suggested, among other things, key access options for police so that they don't necessarily have to break through a window or break down a door (which requires more equipment). He explained that it would be super-helpful for a neighbor or family member to be there with a key on hand or with the door open ready for them to jump in and start CPR, even if they refuse or fail for any reason to do CPR themselves.
He also said he was very worried about any kind of service where key code information or hidden key location information was stored digitally, as he fears what would happen if hackers could break in to the service or if there were any kind of data leak, as that could cause tens of thousands or worse of damage to homes that had a breakin. We talked about it — I think some home owners or apartments would feel comfortable sharing, under some conditions, some kind of "break glass" emergency key code, but we could also primarily promote a social service where you have, say, 3-4 trusted neighbors with your key or key code and we, in an emergency, hammer call those neighbors and organize them to be ready to hand over the key code and key to the first first responder, even if it means, say, waking them up at night to get the key into position and the door unlocked without damage in a medical emergency. You'd have your trusted neighbors verify that the request was a serious one and that the first first responder was there under Naybor SOS / 119 / 112 / SOS direction, and that social verification would help lockout potential feared thievery or abuse from the always present hacking risk. We can't, after all, guarantee even with perfect current security practices, which is frankly unlikely for us to get perfectly 100% right, that our cryptography will withstand more extreme foreseeable situations like quantum supremacy attacks that will melt everyone's digital secrets. 

I'm afraid I again failed to note down all his insights immediately after the convensation, so I may be failing to document a detail or several that are important that's not still in mind. I must get better at writing postmortems immediately after having substantive conversations about the Naybor SOS/119/112/999/000/etc. SOS Network.

He refocused me repeatedly on the access key support service neighbors could provide — he made it superclear that for police that's a huge help, perhaps the largest immediate thing he sees a instant strong need for the right neighbors on scene to step up and help with in their ordinary calls for which digital coordination would be super-useful. 

Again, he was more hesitant about neighbor involvement in any kind of volatile situation. Specifically for instance with Safeword he felt like the knowledge that a police officer was on the way might, in a small number of cases, make a person feel like they had nothing to lose by escalating and even perhaps taking a hostage rather than apologizing and cooperating very thoroughly and fully. Of course, police see the worst of the worst, they're called today most frequently in emergency mode only for the rarest and most violent cases of bedroom consent conflict rather than Red Lights that turn out to be Soft and Softer Red Lights, and they're especially risk-aware and risk-averse when it comes to how confrontations can spin out over the length of their careers. My personal belief is still that many confrontations can be interrupted by neighbors serving as calm examples, outside witnesses, and violence interruptors like they do in programs pioneered at least in part in Chicago. But even amateur neighbors can bring a pair of eyes to bear on a problem that can benefit from stabilization from an outside voice. 

I think to talk with police officers and others concerned about violent outbursts more productively about the Neighbor XYZ SOS Service, it'll be helpful to get Veo3 AI videos together to script out what I imagine these calls typically could or will look like, and we can debate whether that's a realistic and prosocial common calmunity flow we can run through when there's very serious conflict pushing past 1st Amendment protections or very antisocial harassing or violent behavior. With case examples, it'll be easier to debate and raise questions about what role Neighbor XYZ 911/119/112/999/000/etc. SOS  can play in changing the emergency from an epic disaster to a survivable event by arriving with great speed over great skill, with very reasonably achievable quick training / certification and a dose of wisdom and common sense.

Restaurant Hostess and fellow diner waiting for meal
-----------------------------------------------------
I sat next to a woman who was waiting for a pick up order like me and started talking with her. I told her I wondered whether restaurant workers were trained in CPR to treat any customers who may suffer cardiac arrest. We spend a lot of time collectively in restaurants — it would be very nice to know that even in an empty restaurant the staff would be ready and able to leap into action and start administering CPR chest compressions while dialing 911/119/112/999/000/etc. SOS with no more than 15 seconds unresponsiveness and abnormal none or agonal) breathing observation hesitation. Seriously, less than 15 seconds, as far as I can tell that's all it takes. 

The hostess said neither she nor anyone in the restaurant had CPR training to her knowledge. It's not required under Florida law, not even to a minimal, once-at-hire and once-every-four-or-five-year level. She also said there was a poster in the back about how to treat choking but she didn't go through any special training for that or physical experiences to practice the Heimlich maneuver, and didn't think anyone else at the restaurant did either. I find that incredibly frustrating, because it's very reasonable for the State of Florida to impose a requirement that restaurants only offer opening hours if they can reliably treat cardiac arrest, choking, and food allergy or other anaphylaxis if someone gets a surprising peanut exposure or other food allergen in their food. And if restaurant workers everyhwere in the State of Florida were actually well-trained in CPR, etc., that would be a great Naybor SOS/119/112/999/000/etc. SOS base layer of professionalism, since people with restaurant and such service sector work experience (ex: retail, etc. etc.) are so incredibly numerous in every State, locality, and nation, and can be a core strong part of the Neighbor 112/SOS/etc. "Corps" responding to such neighbor emergency events, even late at night in venues where people actually spend the most of their time outside past dark.

She also couldn't identify the nearest AED, which doesn't strike me as surprising or unusual — even I, as recently as a few days ago, didn't know where the nearest AED was from my home.

Thursday, November 18, 2025
==========================
I visited my local calmunity synagogue to find the nearest AED I've been told there is from where our neighborhood calmunity is. They had two AEDs, one on each side of the building, but they were not completely maintained and they were not consistently prepared, packed, or maintained. I had a chance to talk to Operations; they said they'd get on top of it as soon as possible.

Sunday, November 23, 2025
=========================
Today I attended a Basic Life Support course to get BLS certified, the first effective layer of calmunity⁶ emergency life-preserving response currently offered and endorsed by the American Heart and Stroke Association. The focus of the course was on CPR, AED use, and choking response; its content is well-documented, at least in summary form, online.

My [unstructured, unreedited notes from the session are public here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m_PhdVGWe6hZiU9ydRtJ8_uF317Vk2OV_WxshMMgBP4/edit?usp=sharing); warning: if you check them, they're very, very rough and unfinished. 

I'm worried about societal costs. The course cost $64.95 to attend and required the purchase of a $16.80 book supplement for refreshing and staying current on the course over the time to come until my next course recertification. I don't like how expensive this was for significant calmunity⁵ scaling, especially through the length of a person's lifetime with repeated certifications for 50 years coming to about $1,625 USD at that price, unless for instance in paying a rate as high as $64.95 I were to get a very small, private group training experience from a trainer as masterful as this one. 

There were roughly 20 people, I'd guess (I'm afraid I didn't count) present for training, so the company would have made revenue of maybe $1,299 before costs and taxes on that were applied, but just guesstimating ChatGPT is guessing gross profit was about $500-$900 between us, with realistic after-tax profit of $350 - $750. I really appreciate the importance of profit, it's a very core engine of progress, but in this domain where cost barriers reduce calmunity education levels on emergency life-preserving Naybor SOS™ and PulsePoint™ volunteer services I don't want the profits that come from charging such a high entry rate to serve as a cost barrier to the entire calmunity getting certified in BLS, to pull up our emergency survival rate and supplement and facilitate the work of our investments in emergency response. I'm not even sure if I would have been willing to pay $64.95 for BLS certification a few weeks ago, before I started laboring on Naybor 911™ and learned or was reminded of as much as I know now; that's the kind of price you'd charge to a captive audience that through occupational regulatory pressure must pay those rates, with smaller batches of trainees from insufficient, weak, undriven national demand for the course. If we drive demand up for the course and keep trainers as busy as I know they want to be, we can surely bend down the unit costs of training to the point where a calmunity⁵ can just cover the cost for everyone local.

 During the training session, there was one student who was not performing up to the standard that the instructor expected and needed for her or him to perform at, and at one point  an argument broke out about training standards and the expectations of excellence that  must be enforced within the course. The student was not a great fit for the work that day,  and she'll need to get recertified. The trainer was not able to complete her certification,  and I think that it's a great thing that not everyone is certified; that standards are kept high in basic life support training. Notably, everyone else passed — it's a very achievable certification if you're attentive and train your muscle memory. I myself failed too frequently in tilting back the head of  the mannequin that we were training with, when performing rescue breaths. It's something that I  need to keep in mind carefully. The trainer was willing to let me pass with my experience and with repeated efforts to fix that flaw in my behavior. It's something that I'm gonig to have to remain aware of whenever a crisis happens because it's a detail that I am likely to forget in an emergency if I'm not careful, and it could kill someone if breath doesn't get past the tongue or an obstructed, kinked airway. Also, the conflict got so heated that I felt the need to interject with "Calm Down". No one else said anything, and I felt like what I said/interjected in an effort to get the lady to take a moment to rethink her approach was very suboptimal and ignored. So, that's the immediate, proximate origin of [Take 10](https://www.take10.us).

  It's going to be important for the BLS training community to keep really high standards.  If the BLS training system gets scaled up in the ways that I'm going to suggest later in this document,  the instructor that I had was very excellent.  But apparently there have been some scandals with instructors granting certification  without adequate training performance.  And it would be great if the AHA and other community organizations do periodic testing or secret shopping  to make sure that the trainers who are performing this life-saving life-giving service  stay on their toes and fully train neighbors and providers in amazing emergency life support at the basic level.

 After the BLS training session, I and another student stayed back and we talked about the  program and program opportunities.  One of the several very useful ideas that came out of that conversation was the notion  that we can support community training of symptom or ethnic mission for the early symptoms  of cardiac hypoxia, specifically heart clots, by testing our friends and family on their  reaction when we describe early symptoms that are typical of cardiac distress, like saying,  oh, I have chest pain and seeing how someone around you reacts, whether they show concern,  immediate concern, and steady and strong concern, and whether they start arguing and advocating for  you to go to get a check with an EKG having felt that cluster of symptoms that is indicative  of the early phases of what could become a cardiac arrest if left untreated.  There were other types of scenarios and simulations that we could share in community public life,  like simulated collapses to see if bystanders actually jumped into a vein or whether they hang  back or, say, unhelpful things. To what degree people jump and rise at the occasion is something that  we can improve over time with simulated experiences like that and neighbor SOS may be able to help  by coordinating with local emergency departments to put up a geofence, a small geofence, somewhere where  a simulation like this might happen so that the local community emergency centers don't get confused  if people in the immediate area dial 911 rapidly in order to react to that situation.  So it would be very nice if we could have, if we could reach that level of development where  we have a community network that is constantly training and testing with one another,  not every day, not every month, but frequently enough so that we see  cardiac arrest experiences and we hear the early stages of cardiac tissue death and the symptoms of  that enough so that we know how to respond to it and respond to it on behalf of our neighbor's  family and friends and stay sharp. And whenever we perform "Lifesaver Army Drama" tests like that with friends, family, and calmunity⁵, we can and should of course demarcate it as a test as soon as we can without negating the supportive testing experience and explain to people immediately once we differentiate noble response from ignoble reaction that it was a test and that we were acting as standardized patient. Without that kind of stimulated training and experience it becomes too low of a frequency of event for people to instinctively react to extremely well and people don't always know how to jump in an intervene and to do so bravely and confidently when the need arises. We should have ro (zero) or very close to ro bystander hesitation in nayborhoods, not refusal or killer injurious hesitation to start chest compression from 1 in 2 United States residents who witness such an arrest. And there are a lot of other situations where Lifesavers Army Drama can "behaviorally immunize" our populations effectively to rise to the occasion when a real serious event happens, like a quickly spiraling argument without face-saving gestures, a calmness offramp, or apology that's getting too far out of control. I don't yet know what the preferred strategy for heated argument response should be, but it's something I'll be thinking about; I didn't know what I could do when the instructor and the student broke out into quite heated argument to help aside from saying, "Calm down". Perhaps, with better training and testing, I'd learn to say, "Take 10", in the sense of take 10 seconds, 10 minutes, or 10 hours, then get back to it, ideally with mutual humility, mutual honesty, and a problem-solving attitude. But if you need to, you can always take just 10 seconds and then get back to the heated argument if your principles are deeply at stake, the problem is worth the rage, and that's your speech and argument style. I'm not proposing that Take 10 be used to quench all anger — a lot of times anger and confrontational argument is the right, noble, natural, and necessary path. But "Take 10", I'd think, would be a very natural kind of calmunity⁵ tool to reinforce to prompt reflection on whether the heat the argument or situation is generating is really necessary, noble, or natural, and a fast-acting deescalation pattern that could be a Lifesavers Army Drama exercise any catalytic volunteer can start building a Take 10 catalyst training around, teaching teachers how to teach and test Take 10 everywhere, on the understanding that all the world's a stage, and fights and conflicts that boil over can happen anywhere, and naybor bystanders needs to have something they can say that we can all tolerate to strongly suggest deescalation routine without triggering more escalation or hostility. Take 10, when it's the listener's freedom to interpret that as 10 seconds vs 10 minutes vs 10 hours, respects autonomy and gives everyone at least a brief chance to rethink.

Increasingly, I feel we need [a national training program for Basic Life Support similar to what other countries have pursued](https://github.com/LifesaverLabs/NayborSOS/blob/main/policy_proposals/free_national_bls_training/free_national_bls_training.md). If you want to see how we'd pay for such a program, [here are the predicted costs](https://github.com/LifesaverLabs/NayborSOS/blob/main/policy_proposals/free_national_bls_training/costs_free_national_bls_training.md). 

It's also insane and likely, on margin, a widowmaker that the book that the American Heart Association sells for BLS training costs an even further additive $16.80. Assuming a nonprofit model, at maximum the writing and research for such a book should be paid off with capped organizational profit and then distributed for free thereafter, to reduce artificial cost barriers to neighborhood training and ongoing refreshed best-practice memory of how to leap in in crises. It's hard to believe the AHA hasn't already made enough profit from early manual sales to the professional calmunity⁵ to switch it to a freely available internet resource, cutting $16.80 from the cost of nayborhood.org (please someone volunteer to help develop that site) training. Quite seriously, is the purpose of the American Heart Association to train as many Americans as possible in CPR/AED/Choking response with lowered cost barriers to BLS training or to pay [the AHA CEO's ridiculous $4.3 million dollar annual salary](https://www.heart.org/-/media/Annual-Report/2023-2024-Annual-Report-Files/2023_2024_IRS_Form_990.pdf?sc_lang=en), with her taking a salary over 10x higher than the US President? Again, I'm all for strong and free capitalistic systems, especially in markets where there isn't deep distress and duress and overwhelming unmet emergency needs showing deep, long-lasting free market service and systems design failure. But in this market, residents and citizens are failing to keep others alive in large part through the cost barriers the AHA is effectively endorsing on calmunity learning by charging $16.80 for this BLS Provider Manual eBook that's needed for staying fresh on the course. I have no doubt that AHA philanthropists would be happy to cover the cost of developing and delivering an ebook for free for Nayborhood trainees if that were asked of them. Me, I'd myself be willing to donate $100 or more to a buyer's pool of crowdsourced funds earmarked for eliminating the reproduction cost of the Basic BLS eBook accompaniment for the course to ro (zero) for all my Naybors, wherever they may live, wherever I may ever live or travel to. 

These notes may be modified in the future; they're likely to some extent incomplete as I'm rushing on to another priority: working to contact PulsePoint™ for partnership and shared aims. In the USA, they're a superkey partner; the nearest thing we have at the moment to Naybor SOS™ in the Basic Life Support domain. 

November 24, 2025
=================
I was lucky enough or serendipitous enough to see a Cintas truck outside my LA Fitness gym performing restocking. They have a AED provision and maintenance contract with LA Fitness. Sadly and tragically, the guy working was smoking, so I was morally compelled to talk with him about nicotine addiction quit motivation first, though I should have also spoken with him about my very short experience learning through personal experience about cigarette culture and more importantly too about "quit grit", how to sustain his next quit attempt. (I like the phrase "quit grit" in English – it turns quitting into a positively oriented resiliency test strengthening and reflecting a super-core virtue instead of into the mood of being "a quitter", which is, IMO, a very demotivating frame of reference – who wants to be a quitter? Open to other langauge on that for [Blessed/BLED Dialect or American, which I'm also trying to influence, however hard or slow](https://www.enoughisenuf.org)). I pointed him and would point anyone needing quit grit to [Tips from Former Smokers](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/index.html) ([this first-ranked site on that phrase](https://cancer-network.org/outlast-tobacco/) is also really good and motivating) and eventually had to stand several steps away from him to get out of his gag-causing fume plume. 

We had a great conversation otherwise about stocking and selling supplies for crisis response. He shared that Cintas does have some neighborhood contracts in my section of Florida, mostly with gated calmunities, to perform AED leasing and maintenance. I was surprised by that because in a previous conversation with Cintas customer support hotline they seemed to indicate they only served formal workplaces. He threw out a rough cost for AED provision and maintenance, though he referenced sales frequently to indicate that he didn't know the exact price, but he thought it might be in the neighborhood of $150/month (₹13,300/M, ¥1060/M, ¤€130/m, Rp2.5MM/M) for the AED and for regular checks and maintenance of the AED to guarantee everything's up to code and ready for use. I asked him if he [had any checklists or anything](https://search.worldcat.org/title/465378674) that helped ensure that the job of AED maintenance was done well each and every time, and said I'd love to take a photograph of any such checklist or guidance if I'm allowed, but he said he didn't have any checklists. (There's room for improvement there for Cintas if that's true.) We also talked more openly about what else he supplies, and he explained that they stock bleed kits and he showed me one. I regret that I didn't snap a photo; the box came with a nice external itemized label explainer of what was included that I haven't been able to find as well-labeled thru ecommerce yet. I asked him how people get trained to use the bleed management kit and he said bleed management training was provided by Cintas to customers equipped with such kits. There are some videos online I've found introducing bleed kits; I'm still looking for a great training video on bleeds. Then I asked him about whether they stock naloxone for opioid overdose, and he said they're starting to and that he's seen police departments more and more handing out naloxone for free to those who ask for it. That was like music to my ears; my last known understanding was that you'd need an addiction and a prescription from your doctor to get naloxone for free in most of the United States, even if your loved one or a naybor had an addiction I wasn't aware that you could get naloxone for free. I may not be up to date on the state of that program. It's not that expensive to buy naloxone if it's not bought for you by government for free in the context of American spending standards at around $30 USD (₹2600 INR, ¥210 RMB, €26 EUR, Rp500,000 IDR, etc.) but a lot of households even at that $30 level feel a very real barrier stocking it at home if they don't feel the immediate need to protect someone very close. Most won't spontaneously stock it just in case a naybor overdoses unless they know that naybor and have it in their focal attention that that nearest naybor could die if they're not ready with naloxone to save them. Many families, very frequently not even knowing their nearest naybors, let alone their next nearest naybors, don't stock up and then tragically only learn of their naybor's addiction when ambulances or a hearse appear in the nayborhood.

We also talked about AED cabinet quality. He explained that many external AED cabinets get damaged over time from sun and rain; that the right kind of AED cabinet is weatherproofed and costs somewhere in the nayborhood of $500 USD (₹44,600 INR, ¥3,500 RMB, €430 EUR, Rp8.3MM IDR, etc.) at market today, at least perhaps as sold thru Cintas. I've only seen the indoor alarmed cabinets, but yes, some of the cabinets I've seen for AEDs are pretty surprisingly or even shockingly expensive. It looks based on a quick glance online like you can get a basic AED-only indoor cabinet with a sound alarm (perhaps with not enuf room for calmfortable fit of a bleed kit, nalaxone, first aid supplies, etc.) for around $70 USD (₹6,200 INR, ¥500 RMB, €60 EUR, Rp1.1MM IDR, etc.), but outdoor cabinets are a lot more expensive. 

A general point: when I was opening my first "alarmed" AED cabinet to check what was inside and whether it was maintained, I didn't know if it was alarmed in the sense of being connected to a security company and SOS services or whether it was just going to make a noise or siren for the people I was nearby. At first, I was afraid to open a cabinet because I thought SOS (112/911/119/15/999/000, etc.) would be alerted and might send emergency responders. It turns out that most AED cabinets aren't networked to call or alert SOS, at least not yet, at least not in the US. So don't be too fearful of opening an AED cabinet to learn more about AEDs before an emergency and help confirm periodically that everything in your neighborhood's up to maintenance standards.

At a cafe, a woman stopped by where I was sitting and asked me about the five keychain CPR masks that I have on my keychain. Looked like a perfect teaching and health evangelism nayborly opportunity moment to me, so I started unclipping one from my keychain to give to her, and I started explaining compression-only CPR as the key, but the CPR mask keychain as an option in case rescuers don't arrive quickly enough with more gear (AEDs, more training). But it turned out she was trained in Basic Life Support and her brother had given her a keychain mask, she just said she didn't know exactly what it was. I didn't really get her full meaning until later. She also said she was planning to go into emergency medicine, which I thought was awesome, but I don't feel like I encouraged her enuf on hearing that as I should have. We could have had a longer meaningful conversation about that. 

The meaning of what she said only started to sink in a few minutes later when I started wondering to myself if _I_ really understood what the keychain CPR masks actually are. I had never fully opened one of the emergency CPR masks I have 100 of to use myself; and without that knowledge, how can I know with confidence how to quickly and smoothly react if some crisis happens? So about five minutes later, I opened one and tried it on, in the car actually, on my way somewhere. Which, I admit, is a little dangerous to do in the car, but might be the right thing to coordinate and do if you're rushing with BLS training to a CPR event, so you can respirate immediately without delay.

It wasn't what I expected, but I'm not sure what I expected. It's pretty easy to use, but you'd only be able to figure it out very very quickly under stress if you've opened and used one before. They're single use, but I think that's principally if the sufferer side makes contact with their mouth; if your side touches your mouth once I'm not so sure the mask needs to be thrown out. For mine, I repacked the mask and used a sharpie to mark a very obvious front-and-back smiley face on the one that I've used, and I isolated it on a different part of my keychain. Now, whenever I hand out CPR keychains, which I plan to do pretty often in my life, I'll be able to break out my own demo CPR keychain mask and demo what it looks like and how to wear it. 

The alternative is to hand out two for every person that I meet, and that gets more pricey and wasteful fast. I think it's reasonable for these "single use masks" should be thought of as "practice before actual use", as long as you keep your side, which is clearly marked on these models I have, separate from contact with her or him.

I think part of the hesitation for mouth-to-mouth CPR that chest compression only CPR is seeking to overcome is not just the discomfort of putting your mouth on a stranger's mouth, but also doing that with no barrier, and doing that often across a gender gap, which makes it even harder to know how she or he or the community around us will react, and some people, I imagine, become paralyzed by the "weirdness" of it.  If you're not trained in BLS, there's no weirdness — just do chest compressions. Break their ribs if need be, ideally with SOS (:911/112/) on the line on the same page for super-perfect, super-massive good samaritan legal protection. Compress to 2 inches; you don't even have to think about whether their ribs break or not; if it happens it happens, I'm told it's often a very good sign you're doing effective CPR compressions, particularly on the elderly. But if you're trained in BLS, you've got to push past that discomfort with mouth-to-mouth, principally and especially if you have a mask of any kind. Doing mouth to mouth without a mask is not something I know how to call — I think the ruling is don't do it until the AED and breathing mask arrive, since there's infection risk, it's hard to get past the weirdness, and someone with a mask will arrive soon. But they also train us how to respire if we're missing a mask by pinching her or his nose and breathing in to their mouth and lungs twice, and while I carry a CPR mask on my keychain everywhere now, I personally would be willing to even take the infection risk of naked mouth-to-mouth contact if I were caught without one while someone was past the 3 or 4 minute mark around me, or even frankly much earlier, to keep up their blood oxygenation.

I don't want to risk their circulating oxygenation falling off if emergency hasn't arrived yet and we don't know exactly when they will. I don't want to ever be responsible for avoidable brain damage, either by not chest compressing like everyone should be able to do without hesitation, or by, post-BLS training, not breathing in 30:2 or 15:2 for kids in some situations.

November 26, 2025
=================

I had a few very helpful harmless conversations and encounters today, and there's one above all that I want to document that boils out into Naybor SOS problems but isn't itself a Naybor SOS problem, except possibly to secure the expressive right commercially everywhere.

Convenience Store Employee with Civigious and/or Religious Courage
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Background Context

I consumed a freeze-dried miracle berry half at the airport, coating my tongue with it to test its texture and observe how it would crush. I then searched for something sharply sour to eat so I could experience the berry's sweetness-inducing effect. I walked into a Hudson News and selected some sour gummy worms, then asked an employee if they had anything else sour for sale.

She said there wasn't much sour available besides candy, though perhaps some sodas might qualify. Then she warned me that drinking the soda would probably constitute "a sugar overdose." I immediately admired her for saying that, and either instantly or within moments, it struck me that this small but powerful descriptive act could be a sociotechnical and religious miracle in itself.

### The Deeper Significance

I returned to her and explained my thinking, thanking her again for her words. Essentially, the inability of retail food and beverage employees to suggest or freely direct customers toward healthier choices is, in part, killing Americans and people worldwide through unthoughtful habitual and impulsive dietary choices. Retail employees feel—or have historically felt—that they lack the power and agency to gently influence and redirect customer choices to healthier and much healthier choices without their employer's complete blessing. Many employers, tracing back to owners or shareholders operating under shareholder primacy doctrine, narrowly consider monetary profit as the dimension on which they must act and they don't want to say or do anything that could interfere with an intent-to-buy or buy more.

When optimizing solely for profit, employers slowly, moment by moment, chill their own impulse and the impulse of their team and community of employees to provide healthful, harmless hints to customers and patrons. Giving such hints is an impulse nearly all of us have—the same impulse we'd act on for family and friends—to try gently influencing purchasing behavior with fully harmless (or sometimes, with less skill, harm-less) hints in the direction of health. This is the kind of health that prevents nayborhood emergencies one day—predictable and preventable crises like cardiac arrest, diabetic shock, and so much more. This includes non-dramatic, non-sudden disease that limits happiness, eudaemonia, and lifespan, with such trends showing up in things like the routine blood tests we should all be getting regularly as we age, on the scales we have at home, and often (though not always reliably) in the mirrors we face in this life. Those mirrors unquestionably reflect beauty norms and assumptions based in part on how our surface appearance corresponds to our deeper health. These correspondences and assumptions aren't always right and can be awfully wrong, but being perfectly honest, a very high body-mass index like mine at 30.2 or so is typically neither healthy nor athletic/attractive (athtractive?).

Her choice to say I might "sugar overdose" on the sweetened sodas was perfect just-in-time guidance that helped steer me away from investigating those options in the interest of testing miracle berry taste. Which was definitely appropriate—it's inappropriate for me to take miracle berry only to consume super-sweetened beverages I'd prefer to see much more heavily taxed and possibly dose-limited to humane levels by FDA regulation. (Have you ever tried emptying sugar packets into sodas to match their high sugar saturation concentration? It's insane—you'd need to dissolve in 20 packets (20!) of 3g sugar each to come close to matching many of these drinks. Their concentrations are pushed to the physical chemistry limit rather than the human species' prehistorical adaptive limit.) This state of affairs only exists because there's not an overriding calmunity⁵ will to regulate these beverages back to the prehistorical adaptive limit, and individual shops haven't been ready and willing to drop the arms race for sugar-overdose addiction causing so much disease and death to our intranational and international populations.

### Beating Back the Sugar Overdose Epidemic

How can this be beaten back? By giving women and men like her more agency to speak up through harmless and harm-less hints when we're facing choices that can aggregate into disease or death. Her speech needs to be protected so that the shop owner doesn't come down on her for risking or losing a sale or added sale. In point of fact, I did buy those sour gummies I was holding. I still bought something real from the store; I just bought something that was explicitly candy rather than backdoor candy—the liquid candy that pop (I'm in Ohio at the moment) and sodas are.

And how do we give her more agency? I argue her speech was fundamentally civic religious andor divine religious, as it would be if I were to speak with hints at work on questions of health, and I argue her speech was protected or protectable Title VII (Title Sev) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as read as it is and as read under the Florida and Federal Religious Freedom Restoration Acts (RFRA). I don't think her employer can discipline or fire her or refuse to hire her in any way for her choice to harmlessly or harm-lessly hint at work.

Let me be clear here: I say "harm-lessly" because not all these hints will be perfect. Sometimes there will be misfires, and there's a learning process for figuring out what's best to say, what doesn't work, and when. Also, it's going to be the case that sometimes employees won't have the latest level of registered dietitian awareness that certified registered dietitians have under their belts, and even among RDs there's debate about what's healthy, what's a reasonable indulgence, and what's not.

This could be an active area of debate for a bit. At some point, an employee at an ice cream shop redirecting everyone unselectively away from ice cream has such a strict dietary religious belief that her or his beliefs impinge on the reasonable indulgence that ice cream represents when eaten, say, no more than once a week, or whatever frequency you'd consider reasonable. But if someone's becoming such a regular that you see them every night or every other night, then maybe hinting them away even from a scoop might be the right civigious or religious choice.

### The RFRA Argument and Legal Implications

Placing myself in the shoes of a retail food or beverage worker, I'm confident I'd rage against the obesity and diabetes machine on RFRA claims and get myself fired under prior existing law, then be forced to litigate this right into place in the law. And that might happen to the first few who test-case this kind of argument as a civic religious or religious precedent. If only I were a lawyer, I'd offer to represent you pro bono to win this harmless hint right everywhere I could practice. That would totally be worth my time. If I were to win, it would be a lifetime achievement in my state, and reasonable attorney's fees would be repaid on a win per the Title VII in all states/territories and RFRA statutes in the 37 states that have RFRA accompaniment and under the federal government, if you're a test case under federal jurisdiction.

What I want to say is that harmless hints are able to gently move us toward miracles like a healthier intranational and international diet and in the United States, there's two robust laws (Title VII and RFRA) on which you can argue that health choice calmunication is protected under American civic religion (civigion). Because you say so, and have a strong right to say so. Any employer policy that prevents you from helping your naybor live a healthy and reasonably happy life should be read as substantially burdening harmless-hands religious faith and failing the precautionary principle and preventative Trolley Problem test.

I think employers, employees, policymakers, the EEOC, and Courts can work out over time what the limits are, but I really don't think—if you're being as Hippocratic and harmless as you can reasonably be expected to be and not being unreasonable—you should see your speech interrupted or chilled. While I can't guarantee that your employer won't take action if you're perceived to be burdening the business in your health or safety⁵ calmunication efforts, you're certainly allowed under the current law, in the United States since the Groff v. DeJoy case was decided you're in the clear until an employer can show that you're costing the business a "substantial increased costs in relation to the conduct of its particular business".

Work with a chatbot to plan out your local health calmunication efforts and request whatever accommodation from your employer under civic religious or religious grounds if you feel, as I do, a religious-level conviction that it's your duty to warn and fully inform naybors, calmunity⁵ members, and visitors of substantial dangers they face from the products or services you sell.

And this expression of "sugar overdose" could lead to miracles if workers and employees are strongly protected for such health and safety calmunication efforts in the future.

### A Second Civigious Miracle: The Starbucks Barista

It happened again later in the day. I was at a Starbucks selecting between products. I was hesitating between a healthy box and a less healthy option, and after a lot of prevarication I was tempted toward the choice I thought of as less healthy. The barista in front of me moved her head hard to the left side. And so I reconsidered. For me, left is change-coded and right is conserved. I left the unhealthy option behind and bought the healthier choice.

### Population Health Implications

These little calmunications add up into massive health population differences that can lessen or delay the burden on Naybor SOS. These are such nayborly actions—I'm deeply grateful, and I started tearing up when I thought through the at-least-previously-rare civigious/religious beauty of a convenience store employee suggesting and shepherding a healthier option, and the possible implications of RFRA in protecting the ought-to-be-protected health-promoting speech of harmless hands everywhere working with families for our food and drink systems to achieve higher health, whether or not the employers or shareholders are immediately fully on board.

In this experience, perhaps owners and shareholders won't lead the way; perhaps employees will, with the backing, when needed, of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

It was miraculous. And in case it weren't already obvious, I'm not a lawyer or a judge. Only take on as much risk as you can bear. But I hope you'll find soon, around the corner, that harmless and harm-less hints are never punishable even if they cost the workplace you work for some sales and are always encouraged or accepted supportively by employers or managers. You should be able to apply for a restaurant, bar, cafe, or anywhere else and say, "My main mission is to hint customers toward healthier options while I'm on shift and keep them as happy and healthy as possible." Though there may be some bumps in the road, and some might suffer establishing the right and rite universally against any employer counterpressure (the Courts don't move on anything less than injury, and Congress has been historically hopeless on this), that would do wonders to prevent millions of emergencies big and small in the United States in the years ahead, improving everyone's health and happiness in aggregate through individual civic religious expression (or religious expression, if you need or prefer). 

Bradenton / Manatee County⁵ (and Tampa / Naples) (documented unforgivably late on 02025-12月24)
======================================================================================

This will not be entirely in chronological order.

The most important conversation I had while I was in Bradenton was either definitively that with my future spouse, if she turns into my spouse, or if not, with Emergency Medical Service workers at the EMS Station 15 Malachite Drive EMS outpost. 

But before I met them, I spoke with Brad Hughes, the Deputy Direction of EMS who works out of the Manatee County Public Safety Building. My plan was to share Naybor SOS and learn everything I could about the drone survival kit (AED/Naloxone/Tourniquet) program Manatee County has. But when I met Brad, I by mistake only spoke with him about half of what I wanted to share and discuss, and forgot to bring up one of the two driving reasons I was in Bradenton, not just sharing Naybor SOS, which I would do anywhere in any county anywhere in the world, but learning about the leading edge Mantaee County drone program, certainly bleading edge for Florida and much of United States though not entirely unique globally⁵. Brad was really supportive and helpful and offered to connect me with a group at Bradenton Public Safety to start having conversations that could lead to a design and even a pilot possibly in Manatee County, to augment existing service, if Naybor SOS can fill gaps, meet unmet nayborhood needs, and impress on progressive stages of delivery. Brad didn't and couldn't promise a pilot, but he was eager to help connect me/us with the larger, wider team of leadership in Public Safety in Bradenton / Manatee County. To some extent, my follow-up was really weak however. I misrecalled the date his Director would be back in town and ended up messaging him a week after he returned from a break. I need to restore my/our connection with Manatee County as soon as I can with further follow-up to move forward toward that larger conversation with the Public Safety⁵ team, probably after the New Year, considering the human organizational constraints around this time of y⁵ear.

However, right after I left the building Brad was in, realizing that I had missed the occasion to listen deeply to the Manatee County experience with the drone program, I immediately drove to the location where the Manatee drone program was first and currently continues being hosted, EMS Station 15 on Malachite Drive. And I was blessed to find at Station 15 two extremely knowledgable emergency service professionals who spoke with me in depth about any and every aspekt of the drone program and all the layers of Naybor SOS, as deep as I could possibly hope in EMS policy layer preliminary discussion, up to the point where I veered away from their expertise into police or fire questions that they couldn't answer. Though even on those, they had several great pointers and cautions for us/me.

I kept some notes but I didn't ask for AI transcription. I'm very regretful that I didn't ask for taking AI transcription; I think I was afraid that if I asked it would affect the conversation quality⁵ and maybe make them less likely to share their frank, unvarnished opinions, but I think people who are speaking with candor about life and death situations can speak frankly with a natural, almost implicit "good faith discussion" proviso that words shouldn't be taken or warped out of context, that we have a right to revise our opinions, views, and beliefs anytime, that the exact specifics of every implementation matters and may be pivotal in switching from support to opposition and vice versa on a facet or condition of action, and that our opinions don't necessarily reflect or bind our organizations or calmunities, certainly not in a way that can be counted on contractually without further efforts committed to wrighting and certainly not at all times, as we're all imperfect and improving. Just the general human proviso. In the future, I'll be more brave and ask about whether AI transcription is something they'd be amenable to but always I hope with a "Damn the politics; full STEAM ahead" mentality⁵ on preserving life safely⁵ with minimal or acceptable risk thru Naybor SOS project concept (and where advisable, nayboring) efforts. I also am very sad to report that I didn't write down their names. I might not have even asked them for their names. I really regret that I didn't; they were incredibly kind and generous with their time and insight and clued me in to so much about how EMS serves heroically in the situations they see, and how outside developers, designers, ængineers, and naybors can help pitch in to the picture they see all the time in crises that hit them at their hardest, minutes after naybors might have mitigated when it might have been more of a high crisis hill rather than a much more deadly mountain. My notes were incomplete but here we go, attributions will be joint ("AB") for A (EMS Supervisor Trainer) and B (Experienced EMS Pro), except where I have a very clear memory of who said what. 

AB called for naybor watchfulness for signs of exhaustion and other prelim concerns before cardiac arrest or other forms of fainting. They said there should be a option in the Naybor SOS app for "an extra set of eyes for preambulance reasoning, encouragement, and observation", to observe and nudge a naybor, core, inner, or outer to think through their symptoms and reach out to triage if there's any worry or uncertainty question that could turn substantive and pivotal. A lot of people like me who don't have deeply professionalized extended medical training lack the risk appreciation for what symptoms are worrying, super-worrying, and Naybor SOS or dispatcher call triage emergency. AB thought that Naybor SOS could help coactivate naybors and dispatch, or perhaps just the naybor layer, arguably at sufferer choice / option when using the "Let's watch my symptoms" button (very open to other langauge for that — the text label really matters), on early "prodromal" experimences like vague chest pain or heartburn or unexplained sweating or sudden onset of faintness that could crash out, given enough time, into worsening symptoms that are "family or friend drive to urgent care serious", and maybe eventually something "ambulance serious". For instance, just from recent experience, I got stung today the day I'm recording this by something I couldn't see on the back part of my neck. A minute or two later I asked my sister to look at that part of my back and she cried out, "It's a bee! You've got a bee on your neck!" I had no idea I got stung by a bee or that a bee was on my neck still. This case was resolved in part by living immediately with family, but if I were living alone or were alone at the time in a 1 bedroom apartment and I got stung and couldn't see that part of my neck, not knowing what was going on or what kind of physical reaction I was having to it, I should be able to hit "Let's watch my symptoms" or maybe "Urgent symptom monitoring" and go to a nearby naybor to have them take a look and share their thoughts on what was happening. Unless you're going thru anaphylactic shock or don't know if you're liable to such shock from bee poison, I'm not sure most people, getting stung as I had been stung, would call directly to a PSAP like 911/112/999/etc. or other SOS emergency ambulance lines, but as AB argued, they may be much more ready and eager to call out to kores, inners, outers, or naybors to take a second look urgently and stay aside with them so that risk can be better assessed through the wisdom of crowds, with bias toward medical / EMS / etc. professional appearance.

AB also mentioned people may really find it helpful to get training on how to react and relay critical info when EMS arrives to make EMS more effective. EMS really needs to know on arrival if a person has been shocked or not by AED and when. Also for instance, they mentioned that if a tourniquet is applied they need to know exactly when it was applied, ideally to the minute or very close, so that they can react correctly to save as much tissue as possible. Also, it's useful to have a report on exactly what happened and for chest compressions and other lifesaving actions to continue even after EMS arrives until EMS is setup and ready to fully take over. A lot of people stand up immediately on seeing EMS instead of waiting for them to say they're ready for handoff and come alongside and take over. 

They mentioned that for EMS, a person's fully-loaded emergency medical information in iOS or Android medical profiles isn't very commonly critically important for EMS first responders, as it doesn't often have a big effect over what they can find out by visiting the bathrooms and sinks and checking for prescription pill bottles that describe, for instance, if someone is on blood thinners... which is extremely relevant. They would find it useful to receive Emergency⁵ Profiles but they advised it's not the highest priority task because in general they know what to do and how to cope in situations where that information isn't available, and it's mostly diagnostically and stochastically meaningful further down the chain when a person gets admitted to a hospital and a much larger number of interactions and health traits need to be considered for moving from basic survival to recovery⁵, wellness and thriving. I don't myself know to what extent this reflects how EMS copes with present information architecture and limited full-loading of emergency profiles by Naybors, who have to go thru special settings and aren't "forced" to fill their emergency  profile on phone startup, which, from my point-of-view, is a pretty clear legislative stupidity or legislative manslaughter crime, the result of sleeping at the wheel on tech interface policy⁵. There's no reason why phone startup should ask me whether I want to activate Siri but _not ask me_ and _require me_ to fill out my emergency contacts and some basic emergency-related medical information I'm willing to share. (That's another obvious [heedlag / Semmelspan problem]() — it's hard to understand how that never got recoordinated.)

I made a note that I need to accelerate toward talks with PulsePoint, inasmuch as they're the best makers of this kind of emergency software right now that I know of.

AB mentioned Reverse 911, this being the first or second time I heard about Reverse 911 — specifically in the context of it being designed for mass casualty events and massive nayborhood emergencies like the Palisades fire situation in LA. Services were finding it impossible to contact naybors door-to-door rapidly enough to keep up with the wave of fires. Naybor SOS can serve as a form of Reverse 911 too with sufficient development time, where messages can come from dispatchers out to nayborhoods. 

Fire Departments don't fall under same HIPAA rules as EMS providers do, they're on the same alerting service but they have an external service that comes to their phones (Active 911), they'll often get the calls before EMS does since they get the alert on their phones

Speaking of drone tech, the drone tech stays within audiovisual-link line of sight, after it deploys the district chief goes out or Archer the designer and vendor goes out and picks it up from the drop site. The Logistics Department orders and stocks supplies from Archer which they keep on hand at the Malachite Drive EMS Station 15 site for restocking the drone. The reprep of the drone usually is done by the Archer Systems drone pilot (if memory serves). 

We talked about why Seattle is so successful at high CPR intervention rates versus Florida. Part of it is that Seattle and other similar places have made AED/CPR training a mandatory component on driver's ed quite a long time ago, signed 02013-05月08, with an effective date two months later (why wait?), becoming mandatory for school instruction in a health class necessary for graduation in the 02013-02014 school year. I think I would have done it a bit differently and sought to require a one-time immediate training of all children and teens old enough to do CPR in one huge immediate wave, to a get a bigger base layer of CPR/AED/Survival trained youth in the population, followed by resorting to health class graduation pulse sustenance, as long as that health class was around the time CPR could first be reliably and maturely done (12-13) and not positioned all the way out to 16-17. But this kind of "pregraduation" curricular positioning with a full uptake cycle of several years is more typical of nonemergency curricular needs, and it's possible that principals and superintendents prioritized full-school-training, and might have had to anyway to meet the instituted graduation requirement on a "catch-up basis". I learned that Florida where I personally live made CPR/AED training mandatory as part of high school curriculums fairly recently, but it's going to take a very long while if that's all we do for the entire population to have CPR/AED training. To bring most of the population up to speed without waiting for two+ generations to be freshly educated, which takes 50+ years of waiting, I think if I were a legislator I would also push for "driver's license renewal requirements" for CPR/AED/Survival assistance training until the drivers population could be relied on to perform CPR/AED. I took an 8 hour defensive driving course maybe a year and a half or two years ago in hopes of lowering my driver's insurance rates; I could see health insurance companies offering modest health insurance discounts if we take and certify into Basic Life Support classes, but even if they don't I would fiercely support a state passing laws requiring BLS-similar training before driver's license rerenewal or issuance to respond to the opioid epidemic and the leading causes of death of cardiac arrest and heart failure. No US States currently require that, which I think is a shame. In Hawai'i it was proposed in SB 1169 in the 02023 session for applicants under sage 60 applying for or renewing their licenses to show proof of CPR certification, but it didn't become law. That looks like the most calmprehensive effort that ChatGPT found that failed — other efforts have been more tentative and designs slow to populationally-saturate, like New Jersey (A4484, 02018) and Maryland () 

In Seattle they also have an AED on the front wall of all or almost all stores. As a result, there are AEDs practically everywhere in commercial nayborhoods, and that makes it more possible to rely on rescue. 

We talked about Ribbreakers United as a concept. Some people have a fear of causing harm with chest compressions. A pointed out that it's not really rib fractures that are happening in chest compressions - it's more like "sternum-rib cartilege interconnect loosening", which I'd simplify to sternum-cartilege breaking / fracture, and which I think is simpler to just call "Ribbreaking" and lance the problem and cover Good Samaritan expectations with broad risk assumption on the whole range of reasonable force that may be medically necessary to keep someone alive, even if "ribbreaking" isn't exactly literally what's happening in these stress fracture cases inasmuch as it's not exactly the rib but the sternum and its connections that cracks to some degree. Sternumbreakers doesn't have the same ring to it as Ribbreakers, so while I recognize that A thought Ribbreakers United might hurt more than it helps, my belief is that it would help people take courage about what their role is to save another person's life.

AB were asked for their thoughts on the duty-to-rescue and making it legally compulsary and punitively necessary to support a naybor in a medical crisis. They first pushed back on safety⁵ — should anyone be under a legal punitive duty to put themselves at risk or in harm's way for the sake of others? I agreed that in general, any such duty would have to have an exception to allow people to protect and preserve themselves from harm — action in cases of danger would need to be voluntary, generally speaking, except in those cases where danger was imaginary or minimal to a reasonable Good Samaritan. That's how the law is set up in all or almost countries where a duty-to-rescue exists — you are not compelled to run into a burning building or interrupt a volatile violent experimence someone is suffering at another's hands unless you decide it's within your acceptance of risk. As a proponent of universal "bedroom consent conflict interruption", as a means of deterring αpe and Rαpe and all forms of lesser or greater stubborn sexuality, I hate the idea that anyone would hold back from running for a doorknock to wellness check next door or nearby naybors when there's a "Gray Light" (or "Grey Light"... spelling still varies), "Red Light", "Man:go", "Stop stop", or any other Safeword citation. I want everyone over the age of 16 to be ready to doorknock or be a basic-level bedroom ref if something were to happen nearby without fear or favor, without being paralyzed worrying about what I suspect will be the 1 in 1,000,000 case where a "caught" male or female thymically overreacts and escalates into violence against the bedroom consent primary responder (bedroom CPR). But I recognize, from the perspective of the law and legislators, that it would be difficult given peoples' native fears, to "compulsively force" anyone to serve as Bedroom CPR if they live in a world of fear, especially as historical, herstorical, or aberrant stories of bedroom CPR harm might percolate from time to time and be a cause of hesitation. If I were in the legislature, to be frank, given my values and my inherent trust in the vast overwhelming majority of people and their acceptance of interruptive deescalation, I would myself vote for at least an experimental arm to require, under compulsion of penalty, nextdoor and nearby naybor doorknock and basic-level "Bedroom CPR", at least with something simple for anyone to counterreact stably and I speculate super-safely like ["Take 10 (minimum: minutes bracket) to talk under turn-away"](https://www.take10.us) or another stable-under-heat-shock negative affect / stubbornness / violence spiral interruptive technique that gets better experimentally⁵ validated. I do not agree with EMS yet that the duty-to-rescue must end at "cellphone hero" action. 

They described a cellphone hero as someone who meets the duty-to-inform, who calls SOS services and reports something happening like a cardiac arrest or a car crash but doesn't jump into action to protect those affected. In the cardiac arrest case, I argue and believe very strongly that cellphone heroism is inexcusably insufficient. I've previously heard EMS workers describe how some people will get instructions from PSAP dispatch operators to start chest compressions and they'll just refuse to compress, fearing that they'll hurt the person who is dying or that they'll somehow, in some vague way, become liable. Looking at the [Kohlberg Levels and Layers of Morality⁵](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development), these people refusing a dispatcher's advice and instructions to keep a person who's dying alive are on a Level 1 "obedience and punishment orientation" or "self-interest orientation",  worrying if they'll get punished or prosecuted or sued civilly someday for breaking a person's ribs (read: sternum) even when dispatch is telling them point-blank it's morally necessary to administer cardiopulmonary rescuscitation chest compression. I believe it's important to give Dispatchers leverage in such situations so that they can negotiate on a self-interest-punishment orientation with someone who's stuck in that low-level Level 1 morality⁰¹ rather than thinking more heavily about the social contract we all share and the principles we almost all live by with the duty to rescue and preserve life.  I recognize, not to overcomplicate this, that there are some rare unclear situations, like "do-not-rescuscitate orders" not readily-apparent, more typical among the elderly and health suffering, where immediate chest compression might not be, with perfect gods-like omniscience, exactly what the sufferer would have wanted. But that shouldn't cause any hesitation, and with a tool like Naybor SOS and integrations with phone emergency health instructions more and more ubiquitous someday we may even be able to eventually help support and communicate Do Not Rescuscitate awareness in those rare cases where someone doesn't have the basic species intent to accept necessary ribbreaking (sternum breaking) to survive an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. In general though, unless there's a DNR on record and there's time and opportunity and immediate, clear awareness for us to honor it, such as a chest tattoo or a very, very clear necklace unmistakeably obvious on shirt removal announcing DNR that very minimally-trained Naybor SOS responders would recognize (I don't think checking for a DNR bracelet would be a hesitation or step we'll advise as a reliable enuf complication to add to the list of things to worry about),  I don't buy any cause of hesitation when there's irregular breathing (agonic gasping or no breathing), no discernable pulse, and an emergency call open to dispatch channeling resuscitation needs (when service is available and when you're not wasting time to deal with a 200% obvious and hyper-hyper-hyper-emergency drowning rescue that requires first breath far more than Naybor SOS emergency dial). I think if someone refuses to chest compress dispatchers should have the option to tell them that they're at risk of significant jailtime if they don't get brave and chest compress to 5 centimeter / 2 inch (note: there are still countries not on metric) depth, even if it means they need to rise to becoming a very proud [Ribbreaker](wwww.ribbreakersunited.org)[^1], as anyone should be if they break/fracture sternum cartilege or bone incidental to keeping a person under cardiac arrest alive. 

[^1]: Incidentally, I've spent an inordinate amount of time in my life thinking about what kind of tattoo design would overcome the general HhÆÅJ Jewish prohibition on tattooing the body with the overriding duty to preserve life; I've been looking almost my entire life for a tattoo that's so lifesaving that HhÆÅJ Jewish rabbis would agree the duty flips from a duty-not-to-tattoo to a duty-to-tattoo, for the sake of preserving life. I love exceptions to rules, and this would be an extremely important exception to the flashing billboard extremely general strong prohibition on tattooing in Judaism. And a Ribbreaker tattoo that spreads and popularizes the identity of Ribbreakers when they perform such service, prompting ongoing conversation, attention, and readiness to leap in when Ribbbreakers (technically: sternum-breakers) are needed would, in my humble view, qualify as a lifesaving tattoo that, if you commit throughout your life to talk about it enuf with those who see it, would get you probably quite safely to actual, real lives saved. (The only other tattoos I've ever conceived at that level would be the _Holocaust Sentinels_ tattoo and the _Bury Me Twice_ and _Living Organ Donor_ tattoo Family⁵. While it will lead to a great deal of controversy, I plan to make the case with rabbis for all of those over time, and hope that they'll agree and endorse this as a very limited lifesaving-tattoo practice that tattooist calmunities can reflect on and consider over more typical, less effectual floral or skull designs, when the persons getting the tattoo qualify distinctively as a bearer and story-teller of such reserved lifesaving tattoos with even a rabbinic hechsher mark of life-preservative endosement.).
    

The EMS Staff I was speaking to were worried that any stiff penalty like 6 months jailtime in many duty-to-rescue countries motivating with punishment leverage orientation people to perform the moral, civic religious, and general religious duty-to-rescue would lead to sanctions fear that would prevent some "cellphone heroes" from calling in emergencies they witness for fear of ultimately being conscripted or dragooned into taking actions they're not comfortable with.  Their attitude was that any form of cellphone call-in contact with EMS/PSAP, even if they're not willing to get further involved in moment-to-moment critical survival support action, is better than a person dying silently of an emergency where EMS didn't even get a chance to resuce because a Kohlberg Level 1 wannabe-cellphone-hero doesn't call out of fear of things spinning out of their low-grade-moral-autonomous control. So we talked about what that penalty could be, anything from misdemeanor months in jail as a more firm "noodge" to break a person's cynically-self-protective legally-fearful momentary hesitation to a $20 or $100 or $180 or $500 civil fine risk "nudge" for failing to turn into a Ribbreaker or whatever it might be that's needed and safe to perform. Dispatchers, in my view, need more arms in their arsenal of techniques to get hesitators to act rather than seeing witnessed out-of-hospital-cardiac arrests kill so many people on the readily achievable survival probabilistic curve, roughly equivalent to the number of people who die each year of homicide nationally in countries like United States that haven't reached Norge/Noreg[^2]: (Norway) 85% OOHCA bystander CPR performance levels of national CPR readiness and unhesitating achievement. In Norge/Noreg, if your cardiac arrest is witnessed by someone, you can almost be certain that you'll receive CPR. Tragically, in United States, as of a few months ago, that wasn't the case, and every possible root, proximate, primary, and secondary cause of that shortfall from Norge/Noreg should be systematically explored, studied, and treated. 

[^2]: I'm very very grateful to have just learned just now about the distinction between Norge and Noreg in Bokmål v Nynorsk forms of norsk (Norwegian) langauge and people. With Blesséd Dialekt, I'm basically⁵ advocating for something similar to Nynorsk to branch off American Standard Dialect and eventually, I hope, be developed well enuf for it to be taught in our schools alongside American Standard as "Amerikan Standard" (or, if school langauge curriculums prefer, Blesséd / BLED).  


A particularly stressed how important he believed celebrating upstanders and civilian heroes on the nightly, local, and national news is in keeping people aware of how important such Ribbreaker action is. / civilian hero award / heroic bystanders — Boat pullout case, 6 o'clock news, award certificate

I should also note that A wasn't a fan of the Ribbreaker honorific label I'm arguing for with Ribbreakers United. I asked if they thought it would help or hurt the spontaneity of bystander CPR; his impression was that it wasn't completely accurate to what happens (see sternum "loosening"/cartilege fracture above) but he also thought it might turn some people off from performing CPR and might have an unanticipated effect of increasing bystander hesitation. I faithfully disagree until evidence shows one way or another. The existing system of communication has failed United States, we're nowhere near Norge/Noreg, and I theorize that people who are worried about the risk of civil liability would be encouraged to know that we _expect_ in adequate high-quality CPR for there to be some fractures, especially for the elderly⁵. As long as we're honest about it people can make a fully-informed choice to rise to the occasion and make ribbreaking a matter of pride[^3], in the same way that for me, "Shabbat-suspending" / "Shabbat-breaking" as a HhÆÅJ Jew when I have a lifesaving "kategorikal imperativ" to work on is for me a service chain that I'm obligated and proud to undertake. It's all the times that I'm Shabbat-breaking carelessly without due lifesaving imperative cause that I'm ashamed/embarrassed about. People need to know in the world of Good Samaritanship that they're fully protected up to the line of gross negligence, and that ribbreaking (read: sternum-breaking) is not considered gross negligence in CPR; it's considered necessary for a very large number of cases of high-quality CPR. 

[^3]: I also believe it would be very helpful for EMS and other rescue or medical workers to regularly carry [extra keychain CPR masks like these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NPRMSPJ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) (they cost about 52¢ USD/CALM each, aka $0.52 USD/CALM) and pass them out to people they talk to to induct them into Ribbreakers UNited, even showing them from a demo keychain unit that's already opened exactly what it looks like and how to mask and rescue breathe — I myself was carrying them and didn't fully understand them until I opened one and used it; I think it takes seeing someone use it to reduce confusion and strongly improve awareness and readiness before use is needed. It looks a bit funny to put on a face shield in a public place like a café to demonstrate, but it's so worth it, as you win over a more effective Ribbreaker everytime you do for 56¢ plus the very small time cost of your conversation, wherein you have a chance to share and spread your passion. I just bought another set of 100 pieces to motivate myself to start handing out these face shields at a faster, heavy rate again, understanding that there's plenty in stock at home to replace the ones I give away. I'm ashamed to say my face shield giving rate has slowed down to almost nothing recently; I need to pick the pace back up hard in local conversation. I haven't fully developed the Ribbreakers United Induction; I think there should be a quick oath. I should talk to EMS about what should be included in such an oath, maybe something like, "I swear that if the moment or call comes, and they're not breathing normally and have no pulse, I will not hesitate to call SOS and naybors for help and break someone's sternum, cartilege, or rib to keep them alive with high-quality⁵ 5 centimeter chest compressions". I'll incrementally improve that and post a sample induction oath on Ribbreakers United, to be accompanied generally, whenever possible, with a gift of a 56¢ keychain CPR mask that can help save naybors' lives.

AB described how some people when EMS arrives while doing CPR will jump up to talk to EMS and hand the patient's survival (chest compressions, rescue breaths if they're doing rescue breaths) over to EMS before EMS is ready or right noxt to the patient. It takes time for EMS to get into action; don't stop compressions until you're relieved. EMS is trained on redirecting Ribbreakers to go back to compressions until EMS is fully ready but it's an interruption that's not necessary in CPR and could be hazardous if extended.


We talked about fully volunteer medics versus volunteers with stipend support. A. experienced strange outcomes in situations in New Haven where half-volunteer EMTs with the expectation of financial awards for responding to calls were getting involved in reckless, irresponsible, or malicious compliance with the incentives structure, showing up but not really performing the emergency work with the care and duty it required. His opinion is that financial incentives, if given, shouldn't be expected or expectable and shouldn't be routine; they should be structured as a sudden surprise gift of recognition if given at all, as he feels that incentives might shift who responds and how. I can see his concern in a case, for instance, where a person is uncertain if they're the best person to accept the Naybor SOS call, they recognize that they don't remember their training, and there's other cert-qualified naybors with more recent training nearby who can take the call instead. Hopefully our algorithm will help work that out, recognizing that months-since-training/review is worth weighting to a degree of sophistication that current AHA certification systems do more dumbly (binary within last 2 years or not, where 1.9 years and last week are "equally certified" rather than one presumed fading and the other presumed fresh, especially if fresh & repeated or pro), but I can appreciate that throwing an expected $18 or $36 incentive might shift how frequently missions are accepted, even when a person is on the hesitancy line regarding their freshly trained competency⁵ levels. But I think that has to be counterbalanced against the participation rates we need and the value of movement sustenance and instantiation that giving, for instance, volunteer blood donors $20 and a T-shirt with every service donation helps secure, "muscularly contract", and attain at superhigh reliability rates across systems and populations, avoiding unmitigated blood donor shortage crises. We can even "bid" with responders, so we ask you once to respond as a volunteer, you decline, we ask some other nayboring responders further away, they have to decline, and then we go back to you as we stretch further away to more distant naybors, asking if you'll accept and race to sufferer knowing that this is an $18 life-and-death bid we really need you to find a way to accept given how time-sensitive it is. I'd be happy and frankly I'd religiously⁵ need to "doubletap" enlist and conscript on missions that are urgent and lifesaving, and offering a small-token incentive like $18 USD/CALM or even $1.80 or $1.18 USD/CALM can help shift this from involuntary civic religious service verging on involuntary servitude to enlistment and instant conscription into Lifesavers Army⁵, contractually⁵ sertify⁵ed when the stakes are so high that I/we can't be bothered to worry about cash conservation on these mission transfer contract tokenized incentives, where the valuable consideration exchanged fully deepens and formalizes a legal duty to respond where no duty to follow through and respond fully exists yet in the United States law outside civic religious duty⁵. This won't turn into a bidding war where we throw hundreds of dollars or more at civilians to respond. It shouldn't even get to that point — if it ever requires hundreds of dollars using some kind of critical pricing algorithm there would have been a calmunity⁵ moral failure that got us there that it was that hard to get people to drop their other duties to respond to such a life crisis. Those kinds of sums are only appropriate for off-duty exhausted professional service bidding when they're at the end of their rope but still need to be called into service, like an ER psychiatrist working 10 hour shifts who is roped into a second emergency triage call. But those bidding systems don't need to be organized thru Naybor SOS; I think our ceiling offer, with consideration responsibility⁵ muscle-contracts won't get any higher than maybe $54, triple $18. I can't imagine anything beyond that being anything other than an epic failure we should take as a sentinel event on calmunity⁵ ethics in itself. All numbers here are going to have to get inflation-adjusted eventually⁵ and locally-adjusted immediately⁵ to be symbolik and remain sufficient[^4]. 

[^4]: A bit of life advice. If you ever see any responsible person, including your manager/boss, but also of course legislators or calmunity leadership at any level from Housing Ownership Associations all the way up to Congress, talking about numbers on _any_ policies meant to last more than 3 months without talking about and settling inflation adjustments explicitly in writing you should question their calmpetency⁵. That includes salary offers. I imagine the Federal Reserve might hate me saying this, but labor contracts should come with a prestipulated algorithm for guaranteed inflation adjustments as part of a neutral, satisfactory⁵ performance evaluation annually. If you get _less than_ the inflation rate on your annual performance review, that should be a very strong "should quit, they probably don't want to keep me" signal. The Federal Reserve will probably hate this becoming a standard aspect of labor contracts because of unknown price-wage spirals during calmunity⁵ phase-in, if this becomes a popularly demanded HR contract term for clarity between employers and employees on inflation-sensitive annual reasoning, and to prevent drifting performance review cycles and straightforward salary adjustments, like often happens in small businesses without formal review cycles where you just maybe don't know when or if your salary will be adjusted again. But it would be tremendously helpful for everyone, and especially those who don't have the courage or calmunity⁵ support yet or "aggressive" assertional characteristics (especially persons with high power-distance indexes, who feel we have to accommodate the boss's schedule on our salary reviews rather than the ever-ticking inflationary clock) to negotiate and stay on top of their labor contract with the help of a mandatory or socially-mandatory inflationary adjustment term in every labor contract in the State or in the United States, as calmunity⁵ discussion allows. I'll include a model of that in any contract I have written or agreed for Lifesaver Labs in the future. I have direct experience of being "subinflationed" and the drag underhandedness or lack of clarity or willingness to negotiate on the meaning of that has on career planning, development, and reasoning. If you get "subinflationed" in your career _or_ your region, esp. if matched to a proximate and specific labor income index as close as possible to your profession while remaining meaningful, you should take it not as a promotional increase in your income but as a disciplinary warning or quit signal or a sign that the company or industry is under severe distress and can't afford your labor or labor in your price-escalating region any longer. Getting back to Naybor SOS™, $18 USD/CALM is symbolic but it'll have to move higher. Maybe we can freeze $18 USD and tag it to the inflation calculator date Naybor SOS™ first launched, and explain that when we share gifts in the future, so it'll be, say we launch in April 02025, an $18 USD April 02025 gift payment even if it arrives in February 02034 and boils out on payment to universal FedNow transfer of $24.74 Feb-02034 CALMˀ instead. Actually, that's a really important and useful design that I think FedNow would be super-wise to implement, date-benchmarked inflation rate-adjusted payments, where I can have an organizational account and pay out payments per 02026-04月 payment policy in all future months and years with CPI-U inflation computed and baked in to all those outgoing funds transfers, flexibly adjusted and adjusting. That would be awesome FedNow architexture design and superuseful for contract and incentive settlements, like labor rates agreed on today's dollars that don't inflate away with a 3%+ "voltage drop" over the course of the year+"who knows how long until adjustment" labor contract. It's completely feasible to lock those payments in today with low difficulty⁵ with the right tech tree; it wasn't that feasible before the internet calmpetition.

As for nonmonetary recognition, A. made note of calmunity⁵ recognition including hugs, Hippocratic handshakes, love and admiration from calmunity⁵, intrinsic pride supported by naybor storytelling, and other civic experimences like "honor walks" for organ donors 

Doesn't like any money being offered; recognition, handshakes, love from calmunity⁵⁵, dopamine boost versus going if you answer this you'll get $18, $36
