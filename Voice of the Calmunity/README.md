# Calmunity Needs Discovery

This directory contains research notes and insights from community conversations about the Neighbor911 service.

## Directory Structure

### Interview Notes
Individual interview notes using structured templates. Use `interview-template.md` as a starting point.

### Skills Inventory
Track community members' skills and capabilities using `skills-template.md`.

### Needs Assessment
Document identified community needs and pain points.

### Service Desires
Capture what people want from the service (separate from what they need).

### Mom Test Compliant
Notes from conversations following Mom Test principles (asking about past behavior, current problems).

### Mom Test Non-Compliant
Notes from conversations that asked hypothetical or leading questions (still valuable but should be weighted differently).

### Key Insights
Synthesized patterns and insights across all conversations. Use `insights-log.md` to track themes.

### Action Items
Concrete next steps identified from conversations.

## Best Practices

1. **Separate fact from interpretation** - clearly distinguish between what people said vs. what you think it means
2. **Date everything** - insights have expiration dates
3. **Track validation** - note when insights are confirmed by multiple sources
4. **Focus on problems, not solutions** - understand pain points before designing features
