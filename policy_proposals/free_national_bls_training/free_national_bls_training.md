# **The Case for Free National BLS Training: Lives Saved, Wealth Preserved, Calmunity Strengthened**

This is written from a United States perspective but please fork and localize to your local calmunity⁵ — the logic would be very similar. We at Lifesaver Labs admire those countries that have already made these choices and investments, like Norway which has led the way and reached a bystander CPR rate of around 80%, the highest in the world, with survival roughly double the US standard for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival. Our performance is embarassing by comparison. Sweden, Denmark, Finland, France, UK, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and (partly) Australia are all completely or partly on consensus-driven basic life support training mandates nationwide. Naybor SOS™ hopes to get the training rate and personal and social responsibility gradient even higher, everywhere, even in countries like Norway, on helping us build out and cross-pollinate local technology and practices to learn about and trainably react to early signs and symptoms related to all the basic life support topics, and to also handle problems and help organize ourselves to jump in when everything goes wrong and cardiac arrests catastrophically fail. 

A universal Basic Life Support (BLS) program is one of the most powerful, scalable, and economically rational public-health investments the United States or any other country could make. A century of emergency-medicine data already proves what calmunity intuition tells us: when neighbors know how to act in the first three minutes, people live.

## **1. The simple truth**
According to the American Heart Association, immediate bystander CPR can *double or triple* survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Yet in the United States, fewer than half of cardiac arrests receive bystander CPR, and national survival remains stuck at roughly 10%.

## **2. The scope of preventable loss**
The U.S. experiences about **350,000** out-of-hospital cardiac arrests every year. If bystander CPR approached the levels achieved in CPR-forward countries—70–80% participation—we would conservatively **double national survival**, raising it from ~10% to ~20%.

**Lives saved:**  
**≈35,000 additional Americans every year.**

For perspective, that is more lives saved annually than all U.S. deaths from homicide, fire, and motor-vehicle crashes combined.

## **3. The economic value of these lives**
Federal agencies—from DOT to EPA—value a statistical human life at roughly **$10–12 million**. Using a conservative $10 million valuation:

**≈ $350 billion in societal value**  
generated every year by preventing 35,000 premature deaths.

Even ultra-conservative assumptions (half the survival gain; half the VSL) still yield **$90+ billion** in annual benefits.

And this excludes additional gains from other emergencies influenced by BLS skills—choking, trauma airway obstruction, severe bleeding, and rapid stroke recognition—which contribute another **$50–95 billion** in preventable losses and disabilities.

## **4. Total national benefit**
Combined, a realistic estimate is:

**$140–445+ billion saved annually**  
through lives preserved and long-term disabilities prevented.

## **5. Program cost**
A nationwide, government-funded, free BLS program—leveraging existing public buildings (schools, libraries, fire stations)—would cost:

**≈ $700 million to $2.6 billion per year.**

For details and review on how this was calculated, please see [the United States costs estimation here](https://github.com/LifesaverLabs/NayborSOS/blob/main/policy_proposals/free_national_bls_training/costs_free_national_bls_training.md) or [the global cost estimation here](https://github.com/LifesaverLabs/NayborSOS/blob/main/policy_proposals/free_global_bls_training/costs_free_national_bls_training.md).

From a USA perspective, this is less than 0.02% of the federal budget and significantly smaller than the budgets of agencies such as the National Park Service or TSA.

This project especially with immediate PulsePoint™ CPR-responder partnership should immediately start to pay for itself, but those funds aren't internalized through direct government repayment revenues immediately, so the governmental cash flow cost still needs to be balanced out. 

If Lifesaver Labs were in the legislature, we'd need to under moral imperative solve for that immediately by cutting other programs or raising truly internalized revenue to cover the cost of this. That's what legislative life is like under a strict balanced budget standard. Ask your favorite AI tool "What are some government programs that could be cut to free up 3 billion dollars?" and consider which program you'd want to chop. For me, the number one highlighted suggestion was Fossil-Fuel Production Tax Preferences ($3-$4 billion per year). Without further study, perhaps consider that for the chopping block.

## **6. Return on investment**
For every **$1** spent on a national BLS program, the country gains:

**$50–$600 in value.**  
This places BLS among the highest-return public-health interventions ever proposed.

## **7. What it means for the calmunity**
Universal BLS training transforms bystanders into guardians. It restores social fabric. It reinforces that a neighbor’s life is not a stranger’s responsibility but our shared inheritance. It is public safety reborn as public capability.

**Free national BLS training is not charity; it is the clearest, most measurable pathway to saving tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars every year.**  
It is calmunity in action: people united by knowledge, ready to protect one another in the minutes that matter most.
