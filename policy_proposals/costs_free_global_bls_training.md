# Global Cost of a Worldwide Guarantee of Free Basic Life Support (BLS) Training

## Summary
A realistic global estimate for guaranteeing **free Basic Life Support (BLS)** training to all residents (with each government paying for its own people) is:

- **Annual cost:** **$15–30 billion per year**
- **Central, defensible estimate:** **≈ $20 billion/year**
- **5-year global rollout cost:** **≈ $100–180 billion total**

These figures assume a hybrid training model (online theory + local hands-on skills), bulk pricing, and realistic uptake rates.

---

## 1. Population & Target Group
- Global population (2025): **≈ 8.2 billion**
- Fraction aged **12+** (appropriate for BLS): **≈ 70%**
- Target cohort:  
  **8.2B × 0.70 ≈ 5.7 billion people**

This group forms the pool from which trainees are drawn.

---

## 2. Cost per Trainee
Typical real-world per-person BLS education costs:

- **Low-income countries:** $10–20  
- **Middle-income:** $15–25  
- **High-income:** $25–40  
- **Global weighted central estimate:** **≈ $25 per trainee**

This cost includes:
- Instructor time  
- Training materials  
- Manikin/AED practice  
- Administration and QA  
- Online theory components (bulk-licensed)

---

## 3. Assumed Certification Cycle
- **Recertification frequency:** every **5 years**  
- **Annual training load:** ~20% of the target group

Assume **70% program coverage** (realistic maximum uptake).

- People trained per 5-year cycle:  
  5.7B × 0.70 ≈ **4.0 billion**
- Annual training volume:  
  4.0B / 5 ≈ **0.8 billion per year**

---

## 4. Annual Global Cost Estimates

### Central Estimate (Recommended)
- **Coverage:** 70% of global 12+  
- **Cost/trainee:** $25  
- **Annual cost:**  
  0.8B × $25 = **≈ $20 billion per year**

### Sensitivity Table

| Coverage | Cost per Trainee | Annual Global Cost |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 50%     | $15               | ≈ **$8.6B**        |
| 50%     | $25               | ≈ $14.3B           |
| 50%     | $35               | ≈ $20.1B           |
| 70%     | $15               | ≈ $12.1B           |
| **70%** | **$25**           | **≈ $20.1B**       |
| 70%     | $35               | ≈ $28.1B           |
| 90%     | $15               | ≈ $15.5B           |
| 90%     | $25               | ≈ $25.8B           |
| 90%     | $35               | ≈ $36.2B           |

**Typical and realistic policy range:** **$15–30B per year**.

---

## 5. Global Ramp-Up Cost (First 5 Years)
To train nearly all 12+ residents worldwide at least once:

- **Low model:**  
  5.7B × 70% × $20 ≈ **$80B**
- **High model:**  
  5.7B × 90% × $30 ≈ **$154B**

Add:
- Administrative infrastructure  
- Instructor pipelines  
- Equipment (manikins, AED trainers)  

→ **Global launch cost:** **≈ $100–180B over 5 years**

---

## 6. Interpretation Under Your Assumption
You specified:

> **“Assume all governments pay for their own residents and citizens.”**

This global estimate leads to:
- High-income countries paying **more per person**, but for **fewer people**  
- Low- and middle-income countries paying **less per person**, but for **more people**  
- Aggregate global spending remains in the **tens of billions**, not hundreds, on an annual basis.

---

## Conclusion
A **global guarantee** of free Basic Life Support training is surprisingly affordable at a world scale:

> **≈ $20 billion per year** to keep the world CPR-enabled,  
> with a **5-year startup cost of ≈ $100–180B.**
