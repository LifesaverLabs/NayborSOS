# Naybor SOS™ (Neighbor 911™) Theory of Change Press Release / FAQ

## Future Intended Press Release

**FOR WORLDWIDE RELEASE AS SOON AS CALMUNITY⁵ DEVELOPMENT CONCLUDES**

### Lifesaver Labs Announces Naybor SOS: Open-Source Emergency Response Platform to Double Cardiac Arrest Survival Rates, Respond to Falls and Bedroom Consent Conflict Doorknock Need Alerts, Send and Receive General Emergency Alerts, and Extensible into New Nayborhood Alert Types

*Revolutionary neighbor-to-neighbor emergency response network launches with free Basic Life Support training initiative*

**[CITY, STATE] – [DATE]** – Lifesaver Labs Public Benefit Corporation today announced the public launch of **Naybor SOS™** (formerly Neighbor 911™), an open-source emergency response platform designed to mobilize trained neighbors as first responders in medical emergencies, with the potential to save tens of thousands of American lives annually.

**The Problem: Every Second Counts, But Help Arrives Too Late**

More than 350,000 Americans experience out-of-hospital cardiac arrest each year. Without immediate CPR, survival chances drop by 10% every minute. The average emergency response time can vary between 6-10 minutes or sometimes worse—often too late to prevent brain damage or death. Current US national survival rates hover around 10%.

In contrast, countries like Norway—where 80% of bystanders perform CPR and neighbors are organized as first responders—achieve survival rates near 20-25%. The difference is clear: **when neighbors know what to do and how to organize, people live**.

**The Solution: Your Neighbor Can Save Your Life**

Naybor SOS connects cardiac arrest victims with nearby trained neighbors who can start CPR who are trained and encouraged to be brave and, with SOS on the line, to break ribs if necessary to save your life and deploy AEDs within 1-3 minutes—faster than any ambulance. The platform integrates with existing 911/112 emergency systems and partners with services like PulsePoint and GoodSAM, depending on your region, to create a comprehensive emergency response network.

Key features include:
- **Instant neighbor mobilization**: Trained CPR responders within 100-500 meters receive emergency alerts
- **Key access coordination**: Neighbors can pre-position access keys to avoid door-breaking delays
- **Multi-responder dispatch**: Ensures 2-3 neighbors respond to every qualifying emergency
- **Universal compatibility**: Developed with localization and internationalization front of mind with the goal of immediate distribution and testing across all regions, local calmunities, and emergency numbers (911, 112, 119, 000, 999, etc.) that wish to participate
- **Open-source platform**: MIT-licensed code enables global adaptation and deployment

**Free National BLS Training Initiative**

Alongside the technology platform, Lifesaver Labs is advocating for a federally-funded **Free National Basic Life Support Training Program**—similar to successful programs in Norway, Denmark, Japan, and Singapore. At an estimated cost of $700 million to $2.6 billion annually in the US (less than 0.02% of the federal budget), this program would:

- Train 22-91 million Americans annually in CPR, AED use, and choking response
- Generate $140-445 billion in annual economic benefits from saved lives
- Deliver 50x to 600x return on investment
- Cost just $20,000-$75,000 per life saved (vs. $10 million federal statistical life value)

We hope such free, in-person Basic Life Support training program can bubble up in every locality, state, and nation. While you can get the gist of how to save someone's life from selected shorter and longer videos, some calmunity⁵ life support skills are too difficult to master and choreograph without being embodied in training your muscle memory hands-on with peers and master calmunity⁵ trainers.

**A Global Movement for Emergency Response**

Naybor SOS is designed for worldwide deployment with multilingual support and cultural adaptation:
- **Voisin 112™** (French)
- **Vecino 112™** (Spanish)
- **Nachbar 112™** (German)
- And localized variants for every language and emergency number system

The platform's open-source nature ensures that communities worldwide can adapt and deploy emergency response networks without vendor lock-in or proprietary barriers.

**Long-Term Vision: Neighbor 123™**

Lifesaver Labs is also exploring global emergency number unification around **123**—a simple, universal number that serves as a teachable mnemonic: call 1, 2, 3 people to the scene and follow emergency protocol like a 1, 2, 3 checklist.

**Call to Action**

Lifesaver Labs invites:
- **Communities and municipalities** to pilot Naybor SOS deployment
- **Developers** to contribute to the open-source codebase
- **Policy makers** to champion free national BLS training
- **Media partners** to amplify this life-saving movement
- **International partners** to adapt and localize for their regions

"We've built the technology. We've proven the model works in other countries. Now we need the political will and community activation to make this the standard everywhere," said [SPOKESPERSON NAME], [TITLE] at Lifesaver Labs. "Every nayborhood should have trained responders. Every cardiac arrest should have a naybor ready to help within 90 seconds. This is achievable—and at maturity it promises to save tens of thousands of lives every year just in the State of Florida."

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General Questions

**Q: What is Naybor SOS / Neighbor 911?**

A: Naybor SOS is an open-source emergency response platform that mobilizes trained neighbors to respond to medical emergencies—especially cardiac arrest—within 1-3 minutes, before traditional emergency services can arrive. It's like Uber for lifesaving: the closest trained person gets there first.

**Q: Why is this needed? Don't we already have 911?**

A: Yes, and Naybor SOS works *with* 911, not instead of it. The problem is time: cardiac arrest survival drops 10% per minute without CPR. Ambulances take an average of 7-10 minutes to arrive. Your trained neighbor 100 meters away can be performing CPR in under 2 minutes. Those 5-8 minutes are the difference between life and death, or between recovery and permanent brain damage.

**Q: How is this different from PulsePoint?**

A: PulsePoint is fantastic and we strongly support it! Naybor SOS is designed to integrate with and complement PulsePoint by:
- Expanding beyond professional responders to trained neighbors
- Adding key access coordination features
- Supporting international emergency numbers beyond 911
- Providing open-source infrastructure for global adaptation
- Building a broader "calmunity" emergency response culture

We see PulsePoint as a key partner, not a competitor.

**Q: Is this only for cardiac arrest?**

A: Cardiac arrest is the primary focus because it's time-critical and bystander CPR has proven impact. However, the platform can support other emergencies including:
- Choking incidents
- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Major bleeding/trauma
- Other situations where immediate neighbor assistance is beneficial

**Q: Why the spelling "Naybor"?**

A: "Naybor" follows phonetic spelling principles from the [English For Humans](https://www.enoughisenuf.org) campaign. It's pronounced identically to "neighbor" but is easier for non-native English speakers and new learners. Emergency systems should be as accessible as possible, and our calmunity⁶ shouldn't be divided by complicated British dialect and American dialect spelling conventions.

### Technology & Platform

**Q: What technology does Naybor SOS use?**

A: The platform uses mobile apps, geolocation services, push notifications, and integration with existing emergency dispatch systems. All code is open-source (MIT License) and available on GitHub.

**Q: How does someone become a Naybor SOS responder?**

A: To become a responder:
1. Complete BLS (Basic Life Support) certification through the American Heart Association or Red Cross
2. Download the Naybor SOS app
3. Verify your certification
4. Set your availability status (active when you're home or in your neighborhood)
5. Respond when alerted to nearby emergencies

If you don't get BLS certified while BLS certification fees remain a cost barrier, you can still join Naybor SOS™ as a supporter and responder and get a minimal dose of training through our mobile platform. Even if you only watch 10 minutes of training topic videos to become a better good samaritan, you can make more of a pivotal difference in a crisis in your neighborhood than ever before, and you can learn ways you can make a major difference in others lives through small missions among your friends, family, and naybors, like pretending to have one or more heart clot myocardial infarction symptoms and checking to see if your friends, family, and naybors start emergency call and urgent EKG protocol, disregarding cost to save your heart.

**Q: What if I'm BLS and special topic certified or a good samaritan with video training under my belt but I'm not home when an alert comes?**

A: The app is location-aware and also respects your availability status, to a point. You can set yourself as "active" only when you're actually available to respond. The system dispatches to multiple nearby responders to ensure coverage. But if you're in the location of a reported emergency and no other responders are closer or better suited, like when your elderly neighbor three doors down falls at night, or when your young naybor finds herself in a bedroom consent conflict or confusion and signals she needs a doorknock wellness check, we may page you and wake you up from sleep to race or run to get to her as soon as possible, unless you're above age 70 when response becomes optional, or above age 80 when you're deep into retirement and physically demanding neighbor first first reponder status is no longer asked of you.

**Q: How do you prevent false alarms or misuse?**

A: Multiple safeguards:
- Integration with participating official 112/119/911/15/190/999/110/100/122/000 etc. 123ˀ SOS dispatch systems
- Multi-responder verification (if 3 neighbors respond, they can confirm the situation)
- Accountability through verified user accounts
- Clear protocols for inappropriate use
- Emergency services are *always* dispatched—neighbors supplement, never replace

**Q: What about liability? What if I do CPR wrong?**

A: All 50 U.S. states have Good Samaritan laws protecting people who provide emergency assistance in good faith. You cannot be sued for performing CPR during a cardiac arrest emergency or any other emergency if you're acting reasonably and without gross negligence. The risk of doing nothing is often, but not always, far greater than the risk of doing imperfect first first responder service. Just don't jump into any burning buildings or do something dangerous. We never encourage that.

**Q: How does the key access feature work?**

A: Completely opt-in: some users may choose to:
- Share key codes or a physical key with 3-4 trusted neighbors (not stored digitally by Naybor SOS)
- In an emergency, those neighbors are alerted and even woken up if necessary to meet first responders with the key
- This avoids door-breaking delays without creating digital security vulnerabilities

We do NOT currently store key codes or the location of hidden keys centrally, specifically to avoid hacking risks. If you want your digital key code to be on record at your local police department, please call them to ask for those records to be created and kept for use in a qualifying emergency.

### Privacy & Security

**Q: What data does Naybor SOS collect?**

A: Minimal necessary data:
- Your location (only when you're set to "active" status)
- Your BLS certification status
- Emergency response history (for quality improvement)
- Contact information

All data handling follows GDPR and HIPAA guidelines where applicable when applicable and is covered in our privacy policy. For the sake of full transparency, at present no data we process or store currently falls under formal HIPAA coverage.

**Q: Can someone track me through this app?**

A: No. Your location is only shared:
- When you initiate a Naybor SOS™ alert
- When you're actively set to "available" status
- With other responders during an active emergency
- With emergency dispatch systems when responding
- For the limited purposes of pushing you geolocated emergency and critical incident alerts you can respond to intelligently

You control when you're visible and can disable location sharing anytime.

**Q: What about hacking or data breaches?**

A: We follow industry-standard security practices:
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive communications
- No central storage of key codes or access credentials
- Regular security audits
- Open-source code (transparency enables community security review)
- Minimal data collection principle

### Training & Certification

**Q: How much does BLS training cost currently?**

A: Currently, BLS certification costs $65-$100+ through the American Heart Association or Red Cross. This is a significant barrier to widespread community training. We're advocating for free, government-funded training similar to what Norway, Denmark, and Japan provide.

**Q: How long does BLS training take?**

A: A standard BLS course is about 3-4 hours, with skills practice on mannequins. Recertification is officially typically every 2 years and takes 2-3 hours.

**Q: I'm not certified yet. Can I still support Naybor SOS?**

A: Absolutely! You can:
- Get basic-level good samaritan emergency alerts, especially once you watch a few short videos to build up your dose of wisdom
- Advocate for free national BLS training in your community
- Encourage your local government to pilot Naybor SOS
- Share information about the project
- Get BLS certified yourself (current cost: ~$65-80)
- Contribute to the open-source codebase if you're a developer, designer, product manager, data scientist, calmunity⁵ advocate, or supporter

**Q: What if I'm already CPR certified but not BLS certified?**

A: Basic CPR certification from recognized organizations (AHA, Red Cross) may be sufficient for participation. Check with your local Naybor SOS coordinator about certification requirements in your area. We're happy to create new first first responder categories for volunteers with certified or certifiable calmunity⁵ skills that can help in emergency and critical incidents

---

### Policy & Advocacy

**Q: How much would a free national BLS training program cost?**

A: Between $700 million and $2.6 billion per year, depending on participation levels. This is:
- Less than 0.02% of the federal budget
- Smaller than the TSA budget (~$8B)
- Similar to AmeriCorps (~$1.1B)
- A 50x to 600x return on investment in economic terms

See our detailed cost analysis at [link to policy documents].

**Q: Which countries already have free national CPR training?**

A: Several countries have mandatory or heavily subsidized CPR training:
- **Norway**: 80% bystander CPR rate, ~20-25% cardiac arrest survival
- **Denmark**: CPR integrated with driver's license training
- **Sweden**: School-based CPR training programs
- **Japan**: Widespread community CPR training initiatives
- **Singapore**: National Resuscitation Council programs
- **France**: Mandatory CPR education in schools
- **South Korea**: Integration with driver licensing

The U.S. lags significantly behind at ~10% survival and <50% bystander CPR rates.

**Q: What can I do to support free national BLS training?**

A: Contact your representatives:
- Write to your U.S. Senators and Representatives
- Contact your state legislators
- Advocate at city council meetings
- Share policy proposals on social media
- Join local emergency response advocacy groups

**Q: Is Naybor SOS a for-profit company?**

A: Lifesaver Labs is a **Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)**—a for-profit entity with a social mission written into its charter. This structure allows us to:
- Pursue sustainable business models
- Prioritize social impact hard over profit
- Attract investment while maintaining mission focus
- Remain accountable to our public benefit purpose

The Naybor SOS codebase is open-source and free forever. We're also actively considering conversion to full non-profit status or partnership with a fully non-profit twin, Lifesaver Labs Nonprofit Foundation.

### International & Multilingual

**Q: Can Naybor SOS work in my country?**

A: Yes! The platform is designed for international deployment. We specifically work to support:
- All emergency numbers (911, 112, 119, 000, 999, etc.)
- Multilingual interfaces
- Cultural adaptation
- Local regulatory compliance

If you want to deploy in your country, contact us and help build or fork the open-source code.

**Q: Why do you use different names like Voisin 112 or Vecino 112?**

A: We want every community to use their local word for "neighbor" paired with their local emergency number. A Spanish-speaking community might naturally call this "Vecino 112" while a French community uses "Voisin 112." They're all part of the same unified **Naybor SOS™** trademark family and interoperable network.

This isn't Americanization—it's localization with global interoperability.

We do not know if international trademark law will immediately accept our arguments about trademark family protection, but if we need to we will argue for movement cohesion under one common banner. If langauges are willing, and it doesn't feel like butchery, it would make international calmunication easier if the word "Naybor" were to be imported into your langauge as a synonym of your ancient word for a neighbor: línjū, paṛosī, vecino, voisin, jār, pratibēśī, sosed, vizinho, paṛosī, tetangga, Nachbar, rinjin, śējārī, porugu, komşu, aṇḍai, hàng xóm, iut, jirani.

**Q: What is Naybor 123 and why that number?**

A: Naybor 123™ is our long-term vision for a unified global emergency number. The number 123 serves as a mnemonic:
- Call **1, 2, 3** people to the scene
- Follow emergency steps like a **1, 2, 3** checklist
- Simple and memorable under stress
- Not currently used as a primary emergency number in most countries

This is a multi-decade vision. In the near term, we work with existing emergency numbers.

### Philosophy & Vision

**Q: What's a "calmunity"?**

A: A portmanteau of "calm" + "community"—communities that are prepared, trained, and ready to respond calmly and effectively in emergencies rather than panicking or being paralyzed by uncertainty.

**Q: Why do you say "naybor" instead of "neighbor" in some contexts?**

A: It's part of our commitment to the English For Humans phonetic spelling movement. Emergency systems should be accessible to everyone, including non-native speakers. Simplified, phonetic spelling helps.

**Q: What's your ultimate vision?**

A: A world where:
- Every neighborhood has 3-5 trained BLS responders within 100 meters ready to respond to PulsePoint or Naybor SOS alerts
- Cardiac arrest survival rates double or triple (from 10% to 20-30%)
- Tens of thousands more people survive each year
- Communities feel empowered, prepared, and connected
- Emergency response is a shared civic responsibility, not just a professional service
- Training is free, universal, and culturally normalized

**Q: Isn't this just common sense? Why hasn't this been done already?**

A: You're right—it is common sense. Many countries have already done it. The U.S. has lagged due to:
- Cost barriers to training
- Fragmented emergency response systems
- Lack of technological coordination platforms
- Insufficient political will and advocacy
- Cultural individualism vs. collective responsibility

We're working to change that.
