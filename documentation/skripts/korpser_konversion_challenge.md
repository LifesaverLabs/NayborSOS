# Korpser Konversion Challenge

This is written in Blesséd Amerikan but is meant to be reoptionable into any langauge, as we diskover better ways of interreakting with korpsing behaviors and korpsers and konverting them over to lifesavers. Please please please translate freely⁵, experiment to improve this much further than Wei have, and adapt to your lokal. We have a previously horrible saying in Amerikan: There are a thousand ways to ∱kin a kat.

The goal here is to switch a person, kousin of yours, who's engaging in a terribly harmful, self-injurious behavior into someone who embraces a life-extending, healthier substituted harmless behavior.

Admitted, some of this is "windy⁵" speech for a fase-to-fase, so only parts of it might kome akross if turn-taking requires much shorter expressions. 

Naive Experimental Protokol
===========================
Anti-cigarette korpsing
-----------------------
### Variant 1
"Hi, I have a gift for you."
<Offer nicorette gum>
"Kan I trade you this nicotine gum for the cigarette you're smoking, or your next three sigarettes? It's a fair trade."
<Yes / No> (Endowment Effect Issues - Korpser sees the sigarette as more valuable than it is, in part because they hold and perceive it as owned)
If No: "Are you expressing the endowment effect? Are you dramatically overvaluing the cigaretee because it's in your hand and in your posession, compared to its 10-year-faster-death-causing negative value? Would you act that way with a poison stick?"
<Listen to response>
<insuranse talk (only if you are in a kountry that still does not have universal healthkare)>
"If you're insured, are you insured? We don't have universal insurance yet."
</insuranse talk>
"Did you know you can get free smoking sessation quitting supplies from your primary kare team? The number is ________ (korpsing line, if you've got it) / Naybor SOS-triggered emergensy korpsing kall"
"Less harmful nicotine is cheaper than korpsarettes over the course of a year and healthier for you and the rest of your family, inkluding me you're around. If I kan smell it, you're poisoning not just you but me too. On the finankal savings, check the math, and test the kalmpounded retirement and family savings at your retirement age at market index rates for the length of your uninterrupted korpse use, redused by your lifespan and healthspan drop on your old path. I think it's 2x for every 7 or 8 years you're away from retirement at current rates, if you make it that long by switching to harmless or harm less. What's your kalmpound multiplier for you? For me, it's _____ <4.5x>".


### Variant 2
"Hi, I have an offer. Kan I trade you this nicorette gum for the korpserette you're smoking?"
<Offer nicorette gum>
"Kan ?"
<Yes / No> (Endowment Effect Issues - Korpser sees the sigarette as more valuable than it is, in part because they hold and perceive it as owned)
"If you're insured, are you insured? We don't have universal insurance yet."
"Did you know you can get free smoking sessation quitting supplies from your primary kare team?"

### Variant 3
"Hi, I have a gift for you."
<Offer nicorette gum>
"Kan I trade you the nicotine gum for the cigarette you're smoking?"
<Yes / No> (Endowment Effect Issues - Korpser sees the sigarette as more valuable than it is, in part because they hold and perceive it as owned)
If no: "I have this idea that we should rename the currency to CALM. So a coffee might be valued at K3, 3 Kalm. But what's interesting about KALM would be items that are notably unhealthy, like sigarettes, wouldn't be able to be sold in Kalm. They'd be sold in Korpse and need to be labeled like that, or there would be massive legal aktion. How much korpse do you think the sigarette you're holding would kost you?"
