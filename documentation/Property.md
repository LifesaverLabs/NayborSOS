## Reserved Domain Portfolio

We've secured emergency number domains to support international interoperability and future expansion. These domains remain available for development as the project grows:

| Domain | .org | .com | .us | .app | .ai |
|--------|------|------|-----|------|----|
| neighbor112 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | - |
| neighbor119 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | - |
| neighbor911 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| neighbor000 | ✅ | - | ✅ | - | - |
| neighbor100 | ✅ | - | ✅ | - | - |
| neighbor767 | ✅ | ✅ | - | - | - |

| nghbr911 | - | - | ✅ | — | - |
| nghbrsos| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | - |
| neighbour911 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | - |

The current thinking is for nayborsos.us (more UNited States) and nayborsos.org (more global and international) to be the principal internet domains and web frontends, with the rest mirroring or forwarding back to those two primaries.

## Seed Funding & Financial Support

### Founder's Commitment
The founder of Lifesaver Labs PBC is contributing **$18,000 from personal funds** as seed funding to launch the Neighbor 911 / Naybor SOS™ project.

### We Welcome Additional Support
We are actively seeking contributions from others to help fuel and fund this project. **Startup funding is critical** to:
- Spin up pilot calmunities (communities) effectively
- Test and refine our best designs in real-world scenarios
- Scale out proven solutions rapidly across neighborhoods, cities, and regions
- Build the infrastructure and support systems needed for a life-saving emergency response network

Emergency response technology benefits from strong network effects—the more communities that participate, the more lives we can save. Your financial support helps us reach that critical mass faster.
