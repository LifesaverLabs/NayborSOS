# Intellectual Property & Open Source Philosophy

## Lifesaver Labs Public Benefit Corporation

Lifesaver Labs PBC creates community-focused safety, health, and suffrage technology for Naybor SOS with a balanced approach to intellectual property: **protecting brand identity while keeping code freely available**.

## Naybor (Neighbor) 911™ Project

### Trademark Protection
Lifesaver Labs Public Benefit Corporation has an active trademark application for **Naybor SOS™**. This trademark is the **only intellectual property we are currently seeking to defend for the Naybor SOS project**.

**Why protect the trademark?**
- Keeps the "calmunity" (community) effort coherent and unified
- Prevents confusion from fragmented or incompatible implementations
- Ensures quality control and user trust in the Naybor SOS brand
- Allows anyone to use the code while maintaining a single, recognizable emergency response network

### Trademark Family Strategy: Naybor SOS™ and Multilingual Variants

**Why "Naybor"?**
The spelling "Naybor" is part of the [English For Humans](https://www.enoughisenuf.org) campaign for phonetic spelling reform. The word "neighbor" contains silent letters and inconsistent spelling patterns that make English unnecessarily difficult to learn and use. "Naybor" is pronounced identically but follows more logical phonetic rules. This choice reflects our commitment to accessibility and inclusivity—emergency response systems should be as easy to understand as possible, especially for non-native English speakers and new language learners.

**Core Trademark Convergence:**
The Naybor SOS™ trademark is evolving toward **Naybor SOS™** as our primary global brand identity. This strategic shift reflects several key principles:

1. **Language Inclusivity**: The platform is designed to work across languages and emergency number systems. We claim inherent trademark protection for natural linguistic variants including but not limited to:
   - **Voisin 911™** / **Voisine 911™** (French/French-Canadian)
   - **Voisin 112™** / **Voisine 112™** (French/European)
   - **Vecino 911™** / **Vecino 112™** (Spanish)
   - **Nachbar 112™** (German)
   - **Buur 112™** (Dutch)
   - And similar constructions using the local-language word for "neighbor" paired with local emergency numbers

2. **Emergency Number Flexibility**: Different regions use different emergency numbers (911, 112, 119, 000, 999, etc.). The trademark family encompasses these variants:
   - **Neighbor 112™** (Europe, most of the world)
   - **Neighbor 119™** (Japan, South Korea)
   - **Neighbor 000™** (Australia)
   - **Neighbor 999™** (UK, many Commonwealth nations)
   - And similar constructions

3. **Strategic Convergence**: Over time, we hope the calmunity⁵ will converge toward either:
   - **Naybor SOS™** (universal, language-neutral)
   - **Naybor 123™** (our proposed unified global emergency number)
   - **Naybor 112™** (leveraging the world's most widespread emergency number)

**Legal Considerations:**
We acknowledge this trademark family strategy is ambitious and may be novel in trademark law. We cannot afford to file separate trademark applications for every linguistic and numeric variant across every jurisdiction globally. Instead, we assert:

- **Likelihood of Confusion**: Using variants like "Voisin 911" or "Vecino 112" for competing emergency response platforms would create substantial likelihood of confusion with our established service
- **Common Law Rights**: As we operate across languages and borders, we are building common law trademark rights in these natural variants
- **Good Faith**: We encourage international partners to work *with* us under the Naybor SOS™ trademark family rather than fragment the emergency response ecosystem

**Our Intent:**
We do NOT want to Americanize emergency response globally by forcing English-only branding or USA-centric emergency numbers. Rather, we want to establish that **[your local word for neighbor] + [your local emergency number]** represents a unified platform that ensures interoperability for residents, visitors, commuters, and travelers worldwide. A tourist from France should not die in Florida because they're using an incompatible "Voisine SOS" fork. Network effects in emergency response save lives—fragmentation costs lives.

**Why Neighbor 123™?**
Lifesaver Labs is exploring advocacy for global emergency number unification around **123** (see [unifysos.org](http://unifysos.org) for forthcoming analysis). The number 123 serves as a teachable mnemonic:
- Call **1, 2, 3** people to the scene (first responder, second responder, third responder)
- Follow emergency protocol like a **1, 2, 3** priority checklist
- Universal and easy to remember under stress
- Works on all phone systems (no special characters like #)
- Not currently assigned as a primary emergency number in most jurisdictions

This is a long-term vision. In the near term, we work with existing emergency numbers while maintaining brand coherence through the **Naybor SOS™** family.

### Open Source Code
All Naybor SOS code is released under the **MIT License** (see [LICENSE](../LICENSE)).

**You are free to:**
- ✅ Use the code for any purpose
- ✅ Modify and adapt the code
- ✅ Distribute the code
- ✅ Use it commercially
- ✅ Fork and create derivative works

**The only restriction:**
- ❌ Don't use the "Naybor SOS" trademark without permission
- ✅ You can call your fork something else (e.g., "Community Response Network" powered by Naybor SOS code)
- ✅ Do everything you can to make life on Earth more harmless and don't unreasonably fragment emergency response — establishing network effects on a platform like this is going to be extremely valuable across neighborhoods, regions, states, and countries for neighborhood residents, commuters, visitors, and travelers. We don't want a tourist on a trip to Florida to die in cardiac arrest because she was using a French uninteroperable forked version "Voisine SOS".

## Reserved Domain Portfolio

We've secured additional emergency number domains to support international interoperability and future expansion. These domains remain available for development as the project grows:

| Domain | .org | .com | .us | .app | .ai |
|--------|------|------|-----|------|----|
| neighbor112 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | - |
| neighbor119 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | - |
| neighbor911 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| neighbor000 | ✅ | - | ✅ | - | - |
| neighbor100 | ✅ | - | ✅ | - | - |
| neighbor767 | ✅ | ✅ | - | - | - |
| neighborsos | Taken | Taken | ✅ | ✅ | - |
| nghbr911 | - | - | ✅ | — | - |
| nghbrsos| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | - |
| neighbour911 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | - |


The current thinking is for nayborsos.us (more UNited States) and nayborsos.org (more global and international) to be the principal internet domains and web frontends, with the rest mirroring or forwarding back to those two primaries, but if anyone wants to take on the work of developing more of these domains like neighbor112 or neighbor119 with more local flavor and character that would be fantastic.

Please take special note of the variant UK English spelling of "neighbour". It's not as common globally as "neighbor", but it's still a confusion issue. So we reserved the neighbour911 domain too for future redirect.

## Other Lifesaver Labs Projects

### Safeword™ Experiment
For the **Safeword™** project, Lifesaver Labs PBC has:
- ✅ **Issued patent(s)** protecting core innovations
- ✅ **Registered trademark** for the Safeword brand
- ✅ Additional intellectual property that is actively defended

**Why different IP strategies?**
Different projects have different needs:
- **Safeword™** involves sensitive consent technology with novel innovations that benefit from patent protection
- **Naybor SOS™** is focused on community emergency response, where open collaboration and rapid adoption are more important and ethics choices are more self-evident and uncontroversial

### Future Projects
Lifesaver Labs PBC will continue to evaluate IP strategy on a per-project basis, always balancing:
- Innovation protection (where appropriate)
- Community collaboration (where beneficial)
- Open source principles (as default approach)
- Brand coherence (via trademarks)

## Philosophy: Why We Choose Open Source

**For Naybor SOS, we believe:**
1. **Lives saved > Proprietary control** - Emergency response tech should be freely available
2. **Community trust** - Open code = transparency = trust
3. **Faster innovation** - More developers = faster improvements
4. **No vendor lock-in** - Communities can self-host if needed
5. **Global impact** - Anyone, anywhere can adapt this for their community

**The trademark ensures:**
- A single, trusted "Naybor SOS" network that people recognize
- Quality standards and safety protocols remain consistent
- Users know what to expect when they see the Naybor SOS brand
- The "calmunity" stays unified rather than fragmenting into incompatible systems

## Questions?

**Q: Can I fork Naybor SOS and customize it for my city?**
A: Yes! Just don't call it "Naybor SOS" - choose your own name. And we would encourage you to instead consider just using Naybor SOS, so that there isn't substantial user fragmentation and balkanization or uninteroperability across cities, states, and localities. If you're from another country, beyond the Lifesaver Labs primary service zone in the USA, please run as fast as you can to fork and branch this to your local needs while maintaining interoperability. We'll make an effort to make our code support easy ongoing internationalization but please go even faster. 

If international calmunities (communities) make the decision to develop in this codebase as an internationalized monorepo, please don't hesitate to demand better flexibility or service from Lifesaver Labs USA if we're not getting out of your way and accelerating you fast enough. Lifesaver Labs USA doesn't want to hold back lifesaver labs work from any other country.

**Q: Can I contribute code back to the main Naybor SOS project?**
A: Absolutely! We welcome contributions.

**Q: Can I use Naybor SOS code commercially?**
A: Yes, the MIT License allows commercial use.

**Q: Why trademark "Naybor SOS" if the code is open source?**
A: To maintain a unified, trusted network across a large, natural [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law) responder and suffrage network. Think of it like Firefox (open source browser, trademarked name).

**Q: Can I get a trademark license to use "Naybor SOS" for my deployment?**
A: Potentially, yes. Contact Lifesaver Labs PBC (USA) to discuss partnership opportunities. We're open to talking about it and we'll be civigiously (civic religiously) obligated to license the trademark to you in some form if you can show you can outperform us on preserving life and securing health, safety, and fixing suffrage.
