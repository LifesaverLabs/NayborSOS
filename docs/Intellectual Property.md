# Intellectual Property & Open Source Philosophy

## Lifesaver Labs Public Benefit Corporation

Lifesaver Labs PBC creates community-focused safety, health, and suffrage technology for Neighbor 911 with a balanced approach to intellectual property: **protecting brand identity while keeping code freely available**.

## Neighbor 911™ Project

### Trademark Protection
Lifesaver Labs Public Benefit Corporation has an active trademark application for **Neighbor 911™**. This trademark is the **only intellectual property we are currently seeking to defend for the Neighbor 911 project**.

**Why protect the trademark?**
- Keeps the "calmunity" (community) effort coherent and unified
- Prevents confusion from fragmented or incompatible implementations
- Ensures quality control and user trust in the Neighbor 911 brand
- Allows anyone to use the code while maintaining a single, recognizable emergency response network

### Open Source Code
All Neighbor 911 code is released under the **MIT License** (see [LICENSE](../LICENSE)).

**You are free to:**
- ✅ Use the code for any purpose
- ✅ Modify and adapt the code
- ✅ Distribute the code
- ✅ Use it commercially
- ✅ Fork and create derivative works

**The only restriction:**
- ❌ Don't use the "Neighbor 911" trademark without permission
- ✅ You can call your fork something else (e.g., "Community Response Network" powered by Neighbor 911 code)
- ✅ Do everything you can to make life on Earth more harmless and don't unreasonably fragment emergency response — establishing network effects on a platform like this is going to be extremely valuable across neighborhoods, regions, states, and countries for neighborhood residents, commuters, visitors, and travelers. We don't want a tourist on a trip to Florida to die in cardiac arrest because she was using a French uninteroperable forked version "Voisine SOS".

## Reserved Domain Portfolio

We've secured additional emergency number domains to support international interoperability and future expansion. These domains remain available for development as the project grows:

| Domain | .org | .com | .us | .app | .ai |
|--------|------|------|-----|------|----|
| neighbor112 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | - |
| neighbor119 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | - |
| neighbor911 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| neighbor000 | ✅ | - | ✅ | - | - |
| neighbor100 | ✅ | - | ✅ | - | - |
| neighbor767 | ✅ | ✅ | - | - | - |
| neighborsos | Taken | Taken | ✅ | ✅ | - |
| nghbr911 | - | - | ✅ | — | - |
| nghbrsos| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | - |
| neighbour911 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | - |


The current thinking is for neighbor911.us (more UNited States) and neighbor911.org (more global and international) to be the principal internet domains and web frontends, with the rest mirroring or forwarding back to those two primaries, but if anyone wants to take on the work of developing more of these domains like neighbor112 or neighbor119 with more local flavor and character that would be fantastic.

Please take special note of the variant UK English spelling of "neighbour". It's not as common globally as "neighbor", but it's still a confusion issue. So we reserved the neighbour911 domain too for future redirect.

## Other Lifesaver Labs Projects

### Safeword™ Experiment
For the **Safeword™** project, Lifesaver Labs PBC has:
- ✅ **Issued patent(s)** protecting core innovations
- ✅ **Registered trademark** for the Safeword brand
- ✅ Additional intellectual property that is actively defended

**Why different IP strategies?**
Different projects have different needs:
- **Safeword™** involves sensitive consent technology with novel innovations that benefit from patent protection
- **Neighbor 911™** is focused on community emergency response, where open collaboration and rapid adoption are more important and ethics choices are more self-evident and uncontroversial

### Future Projects
Lifesaver Labs PBC will continue to evaluate IP strategy on a per-project basis, always balancing:
- Innovation protection (where appropriate)
- Community collaboration (where beneficial)
- Open source principles (as default approach)
- Brand coherence (via trademarks)

## Philosophy: Why We Choose Open Source

**For Neighbor 911, we believe:**
1. **Lives saved > Proprietary control** - Emergency response tech should be freely available
2. **Community trust** - Open code = transparency = trust
3. **Faster innovation** - More developers = faster improvements
4. **No vendor lock-in** - Communities can self-host if needed
5. **Global impact** - Anyone, anywhere can adapt this for their community

**The trademark ensures:**
- A single, trusted "Neighbor 911" network that people recognize
- Quality standards and safety protocols remain consistent
- Users know what to expect when they see the Neighbor 911 brand
- The "calmunity" stays unified rather than fragmenting into incompatible systems

## Questions?

**Q: Can I fork Neighbor 911 and customize it for my city?**
A: Yes! Just don't call it "Neighbor 911" - choose your own name. And we would encourage you to instead consider just using Neighbor 911, so that there isn't substantial user fragmentation and balkanization or uninteroperability across cities, states, and localities. If you're from another country, beyond the Lifesaver Labs primary service zone in the USA, please run as fast as you can to fork and branch this to your local needs while maintaining interoperability. We'll make an effort to make our code support easy ongoing internationalization but please go even faster. 

If international calmunities (communities) make the decision to develop in this codebase as an internationalized monorepo, please don't hesitate to demand better flexibility or service from Lifesaver Labs USA if we're not getting out of your way and accelerating you fast enough. Lifesaver Labs USA doesn't want to hold back lifesaver labs work from any other country.

**Q: Can I contribute code back to the main Neighbor 911 project?**
A: Absolutely! We welcome contributions.

**Q: Can I use Neighbor 911 code commercially?**
A: Yes, the MIT License allows commercial use.

**Q: Why trademark "Neighbor 911" if the code is open source?**
A: To maintain a unified, trusted network across a large, natural [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law) responder and suffrage network. Think of it like Firefox (open source browser, trademarked name).

**Q: Can I get a trademark license to use "Neighbor 911" for my deployment?**
A: Potentially, yes. Contact Lifesaver Labs PBC (USA) to discuss partnership opportunities. We're open to talking about it and we'll be civigiously (civic religiously) obligated to license the trademark to you in some form if you can show you can outperform us on preserving life and securing health, safety, and fixing suffrage.
