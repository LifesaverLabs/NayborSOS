## 🚨 START YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD EMERGENCY NETWORK TODAY

**Don't wait for Neighbor 911™.** What you can do now:

### Knock on doors. Know your neighbors. Build a network.

**Start with pen and paper:**
1. **Go to your neighbors' homes** and introduce yourself
2. **Invite them to join a local emergency network** - explain that neighbors can arrive in 2-3 minutes while ambulances take 8-15
3. **Create a WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal group or simple phone list**
4. **Share skills**: Who knows CPR? Who has a defibrillator? Who's willing to do a wellness check?
5. **Practice helping each other** - start with small things

**Recommended territory size:** 400-800 meters (0.25-0.5 km radius) - small enough to know everyone

**See our guide:** [Know Thy Neighbor](../Know%20Thy%20Neighbor.md) - How to build your hyperlocal emergency response network
